the heroes of early Rome, a model of old Roman virtue and
simplicity. A persistent opponent of the plebeians, he resisted
the proposal of Terentilius Arsa (or Harsa) to draw up a code of
written laws applicable equally to patricians and plebeians. He
was in humble circumstances, and lived and worked on his own
small farm. The story that he became impoverished by paying
a fine incurred by his son Caeso is an attempt to explain the needy
position of so distinguished a man. Twice he was called from
the plough to the dictatorship of Rome in 458 and 439. In 458
he defeated the Aequians in a single day, and after entering
Rome in triumph with large spoils returned to his farm. The
story of his success, related five times under five different years,
possibly rests on an historical basis, but the account given in Livy
of the achievements of the Roman army is obviously incredible.</p>

maiden whose youth and beauty bring upon her the jealousy

<p><span class="bold">CINEAS<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span>, a Thessalian, the chief adviser of Pyrrhus, king of
Epirus. He studied oratory in Athens, and was regarded as the
most eloquent man of his age. He tried to dissuade Pyrrhus
from invading Italy, and after the defeat of the Romans at
Heraclea (280 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) was sent to Rome to discuss terms of peace.
These terms, which are said by Appian (<i>De Rebus Samniticis</i>,
10, 11) to have included the freedom of the Greeks in Italy
and the restoration to the Bruttians, Apulians and Samnites of
all that had been taken from them, were rejected chiefly through
the vehement and patriotic speech of the aged Appius Claudius
Caecus the censor. The withdrawal of Pyrrhus from Italy was
demanded, and Cineas returned to his master with the report
that Rome was a temple and its senate an assembly of kings.
Two years later Cineas was sent to renew negotiations with
Rome on easier terms. The result was a cessation of hostilities,
and Cineas crossed over to Sicily, to prepare the ground for
Pyrrhus&rsquo;s campaign. Nothing more is heard of him. He is
said to have made an epitome of the <i>Tactica</i> of Aeneas, probably
referred to by Cicero, who speaks of a Cineas as the author of a
treatise <i>De Re Militari</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINEMATOGRAPH<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Kinematograph</span> (from <span class="grk" title="khinêma">&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945;</span>, motion,
and <span class="grk" title="graphein">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to depict), an apparatus in which a series of views
representing closely successive phases of a moving object are
exhibited in rapid sequence, giving a picture which, owing to
persistence of vision, appears to the observer to be in continuous
motion. It is a development of the zoetrope or &ldquo;wheel of life,&rdquo;
described by W.G. Horner about 1833, which consists of a
hollow cylinder turning on a vertical axis and having its surface
pierced with a number of slots. Round the interior is arranged
a series of pictures representing successive stages of such a subject
as a galloping horse, and when the cylinder is rotated an observer
looking through one of the slots sees the horse apparently in
motion. The pictures were at first drawn by hand, but photography
was afterwards applied to their production. E. Muybridge
about 1877 obtained successive pictures of a running
horse by employing a row of cameras, the shutters of which
were opened and closed electrically by the passage of the horse
in front of them, and in 1883 E.J. Marey of Paris established
a studio for investigating the motion of animals by similar
photographic methods.</p>

<p>The modern cinematograph was rendered possible by the
invention of the celluloid roll film (employed by Marey in 1890),
on which the serial pictures are impressed by instantaneous
photography, a long sensitized film being moved across the focal
plane of a camera and exposed intermittently. In one apparatus
for making the exposures a cam jerks the film across the field
once for each picture, the slack being gathered in on a drum
at a constant rate. In another four lenses are rotated so as to
give four images for each rotation, the film travelling so as to
present a new portion in the field as each lens comes in place.
Sixteen to fifty pictures may be taken per second. The films
are developed on large drums, within which a ruby electric
light may be fixed to enable the process to be watched. A
positive is made from the negative thus obtained, and is passed
through an optical lantern, the images being thus successively
projected through an objective lens upon a distant screen.
For an hour&rsquo;s exhibition 50,000 to 165,000 pictures are needed.
To regulate the feed in the lantern a hole is punched in the film
for each picture. These holes must be extremely accurate in
position; when they wear the feed becomes irregular, and the
picture dances or vibrates in an unpleasant manner. Another
method of exhibiting cinematographic effects is to bind the
pictures together in book form by one edge, and then release
them from the other in rapid succession by means of the thumb
or some mechanical device as the book is bent backwards. In
this case the subject is viewed, not by projection, but directly,
either with the unaided eye or through a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>Cinematograph films produced by ordinary photographic
processes, being in black and white only, fail to reproduce the
colouring of the subjects they represent. To some extent this
defect has been remedied by painting them by hand, but this
method is too expensive for general adoption, and moreover
does not yield very satisfactory results. Attempts to adapt
three-colour photography, by using simultaneously three films,
each with a source of light of appropriate colour, and combining
the three images on the screen, have to overcome great difficulties
in regard to maintenance of register, because very minute errors
of adjustment between the pictures on the films are magnified
to an intolerable extent by projection. In a process devised by
G.A. Smith, the results of which were exhibited at the Society
of Arts, London, in December 1908, the number of colour records
was reduced to two. The films were specially treated to increase
their sensitiveness to red. The photographs were taken through
two colour filters alternately interposed in front of the film;
both admitted white and yellow, but one, of red, was in addition
specially concerned with the orange and red of the subject, and
the other, of blue-green, with the green, blue-green, blue and
violet. The camera was arranged to take not less than 16
pictures a second through each filter, or 32 a second in all. The
positive transparency made from the negative thus obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>
was used in a lantern so arranged that beams of red (composed
of crimson and yellow) and of green (composed of yellow and
blue) issued from the lens alternately, the mechanism presenting
the pictures made with the red filter to the red beam, and those
made with the green filter to the green beam. A supplementary
shutter was provided to introduce violet and blue, to compensate
for the deficiency in those colours caused by the necessity of
cutting them out in the camera owing to the over-sensitiveness
of the film to them, and the result was that the successive pictures,
blending on the screen by persistence of vision, gave a
reproduction of the scene photographed in colours which were
sensibly the same as those of the original.</p>

<p>The cinematograph enables &ldquo;living&rdquo; or &ldquo;animated pictures&rdquo;
of such subjects as an army on the march, or an express train
at full speed, to be presented with marvellous distinctness
and completeness of detail. Machines of this kind have been
devised in enormous numbers and used for purposes of amusement
under names (bioscope, biograph, kinetoscope, mutograph,
&amp;c.) formed chiefly from combinations of Greek and Latin words
for life, movement, change, &amp;c., with suffixes taken from such
words as <span class="grk" title="skopein">&#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, to see, <span class="grk" title="graphein">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to depict; they have also
been combined with phonographic apparatus, so that, for
example, the music of a dance and the motions of the dancer
are simultaneously reproduced to ear and eye. But when they
are used in public places of entertainment, owing to the extreme
inflammability of the celluloid film and its employment in close
proximity to a powerful source of light and heat, such as is
required if the pictures are to show brightly on the screen,
precautions must be taken to prevent, as far as possible, the heat
rays from reaching it, and effective means must be provided
to extinguish it should it take fire. The production of films
composed of non-inflammable material has also engaged the
attention of inventors.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINERARIA<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span>. The garden plants of this name have originated
from a species of <i>Senecio</i>, <i>S. cruentus</i> (nat. ord. Compositae), a
native of the Canary Isles, introduced to the royal gardens at
Kew in 1777. It was known originally as <i>Cineraria cruenta</i>,
but the genus <i>Cineraria</i> is now restricted to a group of South
African species, and the Canary Island species has been transferred
to the large and widespread genus <i>Senecio</i>. Cinerarias can
be raised freely from seeds. For spring flowering in England the
seeds are sown in April or May in well-drained pots or pans, in
soil of three parts loam to two parts leaf-mould, with one-sixth
sand; cover the seed thinly with fine soil, and press the surface
firm. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them
out in pans or pots of similar soil, and when more advanced pot
them singly in 4-in. pots, using soil a trifle less sandy. They
should be grown in shallow frames facing the north, and, if so
situated that the sun shines upon the plants in the middle of the
day, they must be slightly shaded; give plenty of air, and never
allow them to get dry. When well established with roots, shift
them into 6-in. pots, which should be liberally supplied with
manure water as they get filled with roots. In winter remove
to a pit or house, where a little heat can be supplied whenever
there is a risk of their getting frozen. They should stand on a
moist bottom, but must not be subjected to cold draughts.
When the flowering stems appear, give manure water at every
alternate watering. Seeds sown in March, and grown on in this
way, will be in bloom by Christmas if kept in a temperature of
from 40° to 45° at night, with a little more warmth in the day;
and those sown in April and May will succeed them during the
early spring months, the latter set of plants being subjected to a
temperature of 38° or 40° during the night. If grown much
warmer than this, the Cineraria maggot will make its appearance
in the leaves, tunnelling its way between the upper and lower
surfaces and making whitish irregular markings all over. Such
affected leaves must be picked off and burned. Green fly is a
great pest on young plants, and can only be kept down by
fumigating or vaporizing the houses, and syringing with a solution
of quassia chips, soft soap and tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINGOLI<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (anc. <i>Cingulum</i>), a town of the Marches, Italy, in the
province of Macerata, about 14 m. N.W. direct, and 17 m. by
road, from the town of Macerata. Pop. (1901) 13,357. The
Gothic church of S. Esuperanzio contains interesting works of
art. The town occupies the site of the ancient Cingulum, a
town of Picenum, founded and strongly fortified by Caesar&rsquo;s
lieutenant T. Labienus (probably on the site of an earlier village)
in 63 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> at his own expense. Its lofty position (2300 ft.) made
it of some importance in the civil wars, but otherwise little is
heard of it. Under the empire it was a <i>municipium</i>.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CINNA<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span>, a Roman patrician family of the gens Cornelia. The
most prominent member was <span class="sc">Lucius Cornelius Cinna</span>, a
supporter of Marius in his contest with Sulla. After serving in
the war with the Marsi as praetorian legate, he was elected
consul in 87 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Breaking the oath he had sworn to Sulla that
he would not attempt any revolution in the state, Cinna allied
himself with Marius, raised an army of Italians, and took possession
of the city. Soon after his triumphant entry and the
massacre of the friends of Sulla, by which he had satisfied his
vengeance, Marius died. L. Valerius Flaccus became Cinna&rsquo;s
colleague, and on the murder of Flaccus, Cn. Papirius Carbo.
In 84, however, Cinna, who was still consul, was forced to advance
against Sulla; but while embarking his troops to meet him in
Thessaly, he was killed in a mutiny. His daughter Cornelia was
the wife of Julius Caesar, the dictator; but his son, <span class="sc">L. Cornelius
Cinna</span>, praetor in 44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, nevertheless sided with the murderers
of Caesar and publicly extolled their action.</p>

<p>The hero of Corneille&rsquo;s tragedy <i>Cinna</i> (1640) was Cn. Cornelius
Cinna, surnamed <i>Magnus</i> (after his maternal grandfather
Pompey), who was magnanimously pardoned by Augustus for
conspiring against him.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CINNA, GAIUS HELVIUS<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span>, Roman poet of the later Ciceronian
age. Practically nothing is known of his life except that he was
the friend of Catullus, whom he accompanied to Bithynia in the
suite of the praetor Memmius. The circumstances of his death
have given rise to some discussion. Suetonius, Valerius Maximus,
Appian and Dio Cassius all state that, at Caesar&rsquo;s funeral, a
certain Helvius Cinna was killed by mistake for Cornelius Cinna,
the conspirator. The last three writers mentioned above add
that he was a tribune of the people, while Plutarch, referring to
the affair, gives the further information that the Cinna who
was killed by the mob was a poet. This points to the identity
of Helvius Cinna the tribune with Helvius Cinna the poet.
The chief objection to this view is based upon two lines in the
9th eclogue of Virgil, supposed to have been written 41 or 40 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Here reference is made to a certain Cinna, a poet of such importance
that Virgil deprecates comparison with him; it is argued
that the manner in which this Cinna, who could hardly have been
any one but Helvius Cinna, is spoken of implies that he was
then alive; if so, he could not have been killed in 44. But such
an interpretation of the Virgilian passage is by no means
absolutely necessary; the terms used do not preclude a reference
to a contemporary no longer alive. It has been suggested that
it was really Cornelius, not Helvius Cinna, who was slain at
Caesar&rsquo;s funeral, but this is not borne out by the authorities.
Cinna&rsquo;s chief work was a mythological epic poem called <i>Smyrna</i>,
the subject of which was the incestuous love of Smyrna (or
Myrrha) for her father Cinyras, treated after the manner of the
Alexandrian poets. It is said to have taken nine years to finish.
A <i>Propempticon Pollionis</i>, a send-off to [Asinius] Pollio, is also
attributed to him. In both these poems, the language of which
was so obscure that they required special commentaries, his
model appears to have been Parthenius of Nicaea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINNABAR<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Zinnober</i>), sometimes written cinnabarite,
a name applied to red mercuric sulphide (HgS), or native
vermilion, the common ore of mercury. The name comes from
the Greek <span class="grk" title="kinnabari">&#954;&#953;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#953;</span>, used by Theophrastus, and probably
applied to several distinct substances. Cinnabar is generally
found in a massive, granular or earthy form, of bright red colour,
but it occasionally occurs in crystals, with a metallic adamantine
lustre. The crystals belong to the hexagonal system, and are
generally of rhombohedral habit, sometimes twinned. Cinnabar
presents remarkable resemblance to quartz in its symmetry and
optical characters. Like quartz it exhibits circular polarization,
and A. Des Cloizeaux showed that it possessed fifteen times the
rotatory power of quartz (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polarization of Light</a></span>). Cinnabar
has higher refractive power than any other known mineral, its
mean index for sodium light being 3.02, whilst the index for
diamond&mdash;a substance of remarkable refraction&mdash;is only 2.42 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Refraction</a></span>). The hardness of cinnabar is 3, and its specific
gravity 8.998.</p>

<p>Cinnabar is found in all localities which yield quicksilver,
notably Almaden (Spain), New Almaden (California), Idria
(Austria), Landsberg, near Ober-Moschel in the Palatinate,
Ripa, at the foot of the Apuan Alps (Tuscany), the mountain
Avala (Servia), Huancavelica (Peru), and the province of Kweichow
in China, whence very fine crystals have been obtained.
Cinnabar is in course of deposition at the present day from the
hot waters of Sulphur Bank, in California, and Steamboat
Springs, Nevada.</p>

<p>Hepatic cinnabar is an impure variety from Idria in Carniola,
in which the cinnabar is mixed with bituminous and earthy
matter.</p>

<p>Metacinnabarite is a cubic form of mercuric sulphide, this
compound being dimorphous.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINNAMIC ACID<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Phenylacrylic Acid</span>, C<span class="su">9</span>H<span class="su">8</span>O<span class="su">2</span> or
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">6</span>.CH:CH.COOH, an acid found in the form of its benzyl
ester in Peru and Tolu balsams, in storax and in some gum-benzoins.
It can be prepared by the reduction of phenyl propiolic
acid with zinc and acetic acid, by heating benzal malonic
acid, by the condensation of ethyl acetate with benzaldehyde
in the presence of sodium ethylate or by the so-called &ldquo;Perkin
reaction&rdquo;; the latter being the method commonly employed.
In making the acid by this process benzaldehyde, acetic anhydride
and anhydrous sodium acetate are heated for some
hours to about 1800 C, the resulting product is made alkaline
with sodium carbonate, and any excess of benzaldehyde removed
by a current of steam. The residual liquor is filtered and
acidified with hydrochloric acid, when cinnamic acid is precipitated,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>CHO+CH<span class="su">3</span>COONa = C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>CH:CH.COONa + H<span class="su">2</span>O. It
may be purified by recrystallization from hot water. Considerable
controversy has taken place as to the course pursued by
this reaction, but the matter has been definitely settled by the
work of R. Fittig and his pupils (<i>Annalen</i>, 1883, 216, pp. 100,
115; 1885, 227, pp. 55, 119), in which it was shown that the
aldehyde forms an addition compound with the sodium salt
of the fatty acid, and that the acetic anhydride plays the part of
a dehydrating agent. Cinnamic acid crystallizes in needles or
prisms, melting at 133°C; on reduction it gives <i>phenyl propionic
acid</i>, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>.CH<span class="su">2</span>.CH<span class="su">2</span>.COOH. Nitric acid oxidizes it to benzoic
acid and acetic acid. Potash fusion decomposes it into benzoic
and acetic acids. Being an unsaturated acid it combines directly
with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, bromine, &amp;c. On
nitration it gives a mixture of ortho and para nitrocinnamic
acids, the former of which is of historical importance, as by
converting it into orthonitrophenyl propiolic acid A. Baeyer was
enabled to carry out the complete synthesis of indigo (<i>q.v.</i>).
Reduction of orthonitrocinnamic acid gives orthoaminocinnamic
acid, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>(NH<span class="su">2</span>)CH:CH.COOH, which is of theoretical importance,
as it readily gives a quinoline derivative. An isomer of
cinnamic acid known as <i>allo-cinnamic acid</i> is also known.</p>

name <span class="grk" title="Kinnamômon">&#954;&#953;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#969;&#956;&#959;&#957;</span>, and by other classical writers. The tree is
grown at Tellicherry, in Java, the West Indies, Brazil and Egypt,
but the produce of none of these places approaches in quality
that grown in Ceylon. Ceylon cinnamon of fine quality is a very
thin smooth bark, with a light-yellowish brown colour, a highly
fragrant odour, and a peculiarly sweet, warm and pleasing
aromatic taste. Its flavour is due to an aromatic oil which it
contains to the extent of from 0.5 to 1%. This essential oil,
as an article of commerce, is prepared by roughly pounding the
bark, macerating it in sea-water, and then quickly distilling the
whole. It is of a golden-yellow colour, with the peculiar odour
of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste. It consists essentially
of cinnamic aldehyde, and by the absorption of oxygen as
it becomes old it darkens in colour and develops resinous compounds.
Cinnamon is principally employed in cookery as a
condiment and flavouring material, being largely used in the
preparation of some kinds of chocolate and liqueurs. In medicine
it acts like other volatile oils and has a reputation as a cure for
colds. Being a much more costly spice than cassia, that comparatively
harsh-flavoured substance is frequently substituted
for or added to it. The two barks when whole are easily enough
distinguished, and their microscopical characters are also quite
distinct. When powdered bark is treated with tincture of iodine,
little effect is visible in the case of pure cinnamon of good quality,
but when cassia is present a deep-blue tint is produced, the
intensity of the coloration depending on the proportion of the
cassia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINNAMON-STONE<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span>, a variety of garnet, belonging to the
lime-alumina type, known also as essonite or hessonite, from
the Gr. <span class="grk" title="êssôn">&#7971;&#963;&#963;&#969;&#957;</span>, &ldquo;inferior,&rdquo; in allusion to its being less hard and
less dense than most other garnet. It has a characteristic red
colour, inclining to orange, much like that of hyacinth or
jacinth. Indeed it was shown many years ago, by Sir A.H.
Church, that many gems, especially engraved stones, commonly
regarded as hyacinth, were really cinnamon-stone. The difference
is readily detected by the specific gravity, that of hessonite being
3.64 to 3.69, whilst that of hyacinth (zircon) is about 4.6.
Hessonite is rather a soft stone, its hardness being about that of
quartz or 7, whilst the hardness of most garnet reaches 7.5.
Cinnamon-stone comes chiefly from Ceylon, where it is found
generally as pebbles, though its occurrence in its native matrix
is not unknown.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINNAMUS<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Kinnamos</span>], <span class="bold">JOHN</span>, Byzantine historian, flourished
in the second half of the 12th century. He was imperial secretary
(probably in this case a post connected with the military administration)
to Manuel I. Comnenus (1143-1180), whom he
accompanied on his campaigns in Europe and Asia Minor. He
appears to have outlived Andronicus I., who died in 1185.
Cinnamus was the author of a history of the period 1118-1176,
which thus continues the <i>Alexiad</i> of Anna Comnena, and embraces
the reigns of John II. and Manuel I., down to the unsuccessful
campaign of the latter against the Turks, which ended
with the disastrous battle of Myriokephalon and the rout of
the Byzantine army. Cinnamus was probably an eye-witness
of the events of the last ten years which he describes. The work
breaks off abruptly; originally it no doubt went down to the
death of Manuel, and there are indications that, even in its
present form, it is an abridgment. The text is in a very corrupt
state. The author&rsquo;s hero is Manuel; he is strongly impressed
with the superiority of the East to the West, and is a determined
opponent of the pretensions of the papacy. But he
cannot be reproached with undue bias; he writes with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
straightforwardness of a soldier, and is not ashamed on occasion
to confess his ignorance. The matter is well arranged, the style
(modelled on that of Xenophon) simple, and on the whole free
from the usual florid bombast of the Byzantine writers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINNOLIN<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span>, C<span class="su">8</span>H<span class="su">6</span>N<span class="su">2</span>, a compound isomeric with phthalazine,
prepared by boiling dihydrocinnolin dissolved in benzene with
freshly precipitated mercuric oxide. The solution is filtered
and the hydrochloride of the base precipitated by alcoholic
hydrochloric acid; the free base is obtained as an oil by adding
caustic soda. It may be obtained in white silky needles, melting
at 24-25°C. and containing a molecule of ether of crystallization
by cooling the oil dissolved in ether. The free base melts at
39°C. It is a strong base, forming stable salts with mineral
acids, and is easily soluble in water and in the ordinary organic
solvents. It has a taste resembling that of chloral hydrate,
and leaves a sharp irritation for some time on the tongue; it is
also very poisonous (M. Busch and A. Rast, <i>Berichte</i>, 1897, 30,
p. 521). Cinnolin derivatives are obtained from oxycinnolin
carboxylic acid, which is formed by digesting orthophenyl
propiolic acid diazo chloride with water. Oxycinnolin carboxylic
acid on heating gives oxycinnolin, melting at 225°,
which with phosphorus pentachloride gives chlorcinnolin. This
substance is reduced by iron filings and sulphuric acid to dihydrocinnolin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINO DA PISTOIA<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1270-1336), Italian poet and jurist,
whose full name was <span class="sc">Guittoncino de&rsquo; Sinibaldi</span>, was born in
Pistoia, of a noble family. He studied law at Bologna under
Dinus Muggelanus (Dino de Rossonis: d. 1303) and Franciscus
Accursius, and in 1307 is understood to have been assessor of
civil causes in his native city. In that year, however, Pistoia
was disturbed by the Guelph and Ghibelline feud. The Ghibellines,
who had for some time been the stronger party, being
worsted by the Guelphs, Cino, a prominent member of the former
faction, had to quit his office and the city of his birth. Pitecchio,
a stronghold on the frontiers of Lombardy, was yet in the hands
of Filippo Vergiolesi, chief of the Pistoian Ghibellines; Selvaggia,
his daughter, was beloved by Cino (who was probably already
the husband of Margherita degli Unghi); and to Pitecchio did
the lawyer-poet betake himself. It is uncertain how long he
remained at the fortress; it is certain, however, that he was not
with the Vergiolesi at the time of Selvaggia&rsquo;s death, which
happened three years afterwards (1310), at the Monte della
Sambuca, in the Apennines, whither the Ghibellines had been
compelled to shift their camp. He visited his mistress&rsquo;s grave
on his way to Rome, after some time spent in travel in France
and elsewhere, and to this visit is owing his finest sonnet. At
Rome Cino held office under Louis of Savoy, sent thither by
the Ghibelline leader Henry of Luxemburg, who was crowned
emperor of the Romans in 1312. In 1313, however, the emperor
died, and the Ghibellines lost their last hope. Cino appears to
have thrown up his party, and to have returned to Pistoia.
Thereafter he devoted himself to law and letters. After filling
several high judicial offices, a doctor of civil law of Bologna in
his forty-fourth year, he lectured and taught from the professor&rsquo;s
chair at the universities of Treviso, Siena, Florence and Perugia
in succession; his reputation and success were great, his judicial
experience enabling him to travel out of the routine of the schools.
In literature he continued in some sort the tradition of Dante
during the interval dividing that great poet from his successor
Petrarch. The latter, besides celebrating Cino in an obituary
sonnet, has coupled him and his Selvaggia with Dante and
Beatrice in the fourth <i>capitolo</i> of his <i>Trionfi d&rsquo; Amore</i>.</p>

<p>Cino, the master of Bartolus, and of Joannes Andreae the
celebrated canonist, was long famed as a jurist. His commentary
on the statutes of Pistoia, written within two years, is said to
have great merit; while that on the code (<i>Lectura Cino Pistoia
super codice</i>, Pavia, 1483; Lyons, 1526) is considered by Savigny
to exhibit more practical intelligence and more originality of
thought than are found in any commentary on Roman law since
the time of Accursius. As a poet he also distinguished himself
greatly. He was the friend and correspondent of Dante&rsquo;s later
years, and possibly of his earlier also, and was certainly, with
Guido Cavalcanti and Durante da Maiano, one of those who
replied to the famous sonnet <i>A ciascun&rsquo; alma presa e gentil core</i>
of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>. In the treatise <i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i> Dante
refers to him as one of &ldquo;those who have most sweetly and subtly
written poems in modern Italian,&rdquo; but his works, printed at
Rome in 1559, do not altogether justify the praise. Strained and
rhetorical as many of his outcries are, however, Cino is not
without moments of true passion and fine natural eloquence.
Of these qualities the sonnet in memory of Selvaggia, <i>Io
fui in sull&rsquo; alto e in sul beato monte</i>, and the canzone to Dante,
<i>Avegnachè di omaggio più per tempo</i>, are interesting examples.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The text-book for English readers is D.G. Rossetti&rsquo;s <i>Early Italian
Poets</i>, wherein will be found not only a memoir of Cino da Pistoia,
but also some admirably translated specimens of his verse&mdash;the
whole wrought into significant connexion with that friendship of
Cino&rsquo;s which is perhaps the most interesting fact about him. See
also Ciampi, <i>Vita e poesie di messer Cino da Pistoia</i> (Pisa, 1813).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CINQ-MARS, HENRI COIFFIER RUZÉ D&rsquo;EFFIAT<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Marquis
de</span> (1620-1642), French courtier, was the second son of Antoine
Coiffier Ruzé, marquis d&rsquo;Effiat, marshal of France (1581-1632),
and was introduced to the court of Louis XIII. by Richelieu,
who had been a friend of his father and who hoped he would
counteract the influence of the queen&rsquo;s favourite Mlle. de
Hautefort. Owing to his handsome appearance and agreeable
manners he soon became a favourite of the king, and was made
successively master of the wardrobe and master of the horse.
After distinguishing himself at the siege of Arras in 1640, Cinq-Mars
wished for a high military command, but Richelieu opposed
his pretensions and the favourite talked rashly about overthrowing
the minister. He was probably connected with the
abortive rising of the count of Soissons in 1641; however that
may be, in the following year he formed a conspiracy with the
duke of Bouillon and others to overthrow Richelieu. This plot
was under the nominal leadership of the king&rsquo;s brother Gaston
of Orleans. The plans of the conspirators were aided by the
illness of Richelieu and his absence from the king, and at the
siege of Narbonne Cinq-Mars almost induced Louis to agree to
banish his minister. Richelieu, however, recovered, became
acquainted with the attempt of Cinq-Mars to obtain assistance
from Spain, and laid the proofs of his treason before the king,
who ordered his arrest. Cinq-Mars was brought to trial, admitted
his guilt, and was condemned to death. He was executed at
Lyons on the 12th of September 1642. It is possible that
Cinq-Mars was urged to engage in this conspiracy by his affection
for Louise Marie de Gonzaga (1612-1667), afterwards queen of
Poland, who was a prominent figure at the court of Louis XIII.;
and this tradition forms part of the plot of Alfred de Vigny&rsquo;s
novel <i>Cinq-Mars</i>.</p>

architecture, the style which became prevalent in Italy in the
century following 1500, now usually called &ldquo;16th-century work.&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">CINQUE PORTS<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span>, the name of an ancient jurisdiction in the
south of England, which is still maintained with considerable
modifications and diminished authority. As the name implies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
the ports originally constituting the body were only five in
number&mdash;Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich;
but to these were afterwards added the &ldquo;ancient towns&rdquo; of
Winchelsea and Rye with the same privileges, and a good many
other places, both corporate and non-corporate, which, with
the title of limb or member, held a subordinate position. To
Hastings were attached the corporate members of Pevensey
and Seaford, and the non-corporate members of Bulvarhythe,
Petit Iham (Yham or Higham), Hydney, Bekesbourn, Northeye
and Grenche or Grange; to Romney, Lydd, and Old Romney,
Dengemarsh, Orwaldstone, and Bromehill or Promehill; to
Dover, Folkestone and Faversham, and Margate, St John&rsquo;s,
Goresend (now Birchington), Birchington Wood (now Woodchurch),
St Peter&rsquo;s, Kingsdown and Ringwould; to Sandwich,
Fordwich and Deal, and Walmer, Ramsgate, Reculver, Stonor
(Estanor), Sarre (or Serre) and Brightlingsea (in Essex). To
Rye was attached the corporate member of Tenterden, and to a
Hythe the non-corporate member of West Hythe. The jurisdiction
thus extends along the coast from Seaford in Sussex
to Birchington near Margate in Kent; and it also includes a
number of inland districts, at a considerable distance from the
ports with which they are connected. The non-incorporated
members are within the municipal jurisdiction of the ports to
which they are attached; but the corporate members are as
free within their own liberties as the individual ports themselves.</p>

<p>The incorporation of the Cinque Ports had its origin in the
necessity for some means of defence along the southern seaboard
of England, and in the lack of any regular navy. Up to the
reign of Henry VII. they had to furnish the crown with nearly
all the ships and men that were needful for the state; and for
a long time after they were required to give large assistance to
the permanent fleet. The oldest charter now on record is one
belonging to the 6th year of Edward I.; and it refers to previous
documents of the time of Edward the Confessor and William
the Conqueror. In return for their services the ports enjoyed
extensive privileges. From the Conquest or even earlier they
had, besides various lesser rights&mdash;(1) exemption from tax
and tallage; (2) soc and sac, or full cognizance of all criminal
and civil cases within their liberties; (3) tol and team, or the
right of receiving toll and the right of compelling the person
in whose hands stolen property was found to name the person
from whom he received it; (4) blodwit and fledwit, or the right
to punish shedders of blood and those who were seized in an
attempt to escape from justice; (5) pillory and tumbrel; (6)
infangentheof and outfangentheof, or power to imprison and
execute felons; (7) mundbryce (the breaking into or violation
of a man&rsquo;s <i>mund</i> or property in order to erect banks or
dikes as a defence against the sea); (8) waives and strays,
or the right to appropriate lost property or cattle not claimed
within a year and a day; (9) the right to seize all flotsam,
jetsam, or ligan, or, in other words, whatever of value was cast
ashore by the sea; (10) the privilege of being a gild with power
to impose taxes for the common weal; and (11) the right of
assembling in portmote or parliament at Shepway or Shepway
Cross, a few miles west of Hythe (but afterwards at Dover),
the parliament being empowered to make by-laws for the
Cinque Ports, to regulate the Yarmouth fishery, to hear appeals
from the local courts, and to give decision in all cases of treason,
sedition, illegal coining or concealment of treasure trove. The
ordinary business of the ports was conducted in two courts
known respectively as the court of brotherhood and the court
of brotherhood and guestling,&mdash;the former being composed of
the mayors of the seven principal towns and a number of jurats
and freemen from each, and the latter including in addition the
mayors, bailiffs and other representatives of the corporate
members. The court of brotherhood was formerly called the
brotheryeeld, brodall or brodhull; and the name guestling
seems to owe its origin to the fact that the officials of the
&ldquo;members&rdquo; were at first in the position of invited guests.</p>

<p>The highest office in connexion with the Cinque Ports is that
of the lord warden, who also acts as governor of Dover Castle,
and has a maritime jurisdiction (<i>vide infra</i>) as admiral of the
ports. His power was formerly of great extent, but he has now
practically no important duty to exercise except that of chairman
of the Dover harbour board. The emoluments of the office are
confined to certain insignificant admiralty droits. The patronage
attached to the office consists of the right to appoint the judge
of the Cinque Ports admiralty court, the registrar of the Cinque
Ports and the marshal of the court; the right of appointing
salvage commissioners at each Cinque Port and the appointment
of a deputy to act as chairman of the Dover harbour board in
the absence of the lord warden. Walmer Castle was for long
the official residence of the lord warden, but has, since the
resignation of Lord Curzon in 1903, ceased to be so used, and
those portions of it which are of historic interest are now open
to the public. George, prince of Wales (lord warden, 1903-1907),
was the first lord warden of royal blood since the office was held
by George, prince of Denmark, consort of Queen Anne.</p>

<p><i>Admiralty Jurisdiction.</i>&mdash;The court of admiralty for the
Cinque Ports exercises a co-ordinate but not exclusive admiralty
jurisdiction over persons and things found within the territory
of the Cinque Ports. The limits of its jurisdiction were declared
at an inquisition taken at the court of admiralty, held by the
seaside at Dover in 1682, to extend from Shore Beacon in Essex
to Redcliff, near Seaford, in Sussex; and with regard to salvage,
they comprise all the sea between Seaford in Sussex to a point
five miles off Cape Grisnez on the coast of France, and the coast
of Essex. An older inquisition of 1526 is given by R.G. Marsden
in his <i>Select Pleas of the Court of Admiralty</i>, II. xxx. The court
is an ancient one. The judge sits as the official and commissary
of the lord warden, just as the judge of the high court of admiralty
sat as the official and commissary of the lord high admiral. And,
as the office of lord warden is more ancient than the office of
lord high admiral (<i>The Lord Warden</i> v. <i>King in his office of
Admiralty</i>, 1831, 2 Hagg. Admy. Rep. 438), it is probable that
the Cinque Ports court is the more ancient of the two.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the court has been, except in one matter
of mere antiquarian curiosity, unaffected by statute. It exercises
only, therefore, such jurisdiction as the high court of admiralty
exercised, apart from restraining statutes of 1389 and 1391 and
enabling statutes of 1840 and 1861. Cases of collision have been
tried in it (the &ldquo;Vivid,&rdquo; 1 <i>Asp. Maritime Law Cases</i>, 601).
But salvage cases (the &ldquo;Clarisse,&rdquo; <i>Swabey</i>, 129; the &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo;
<i>Law. Rep. 7 P.D.</i> 203) are the principal cases now tried. It has
no prize jurisdiction. The one case in which jurisdiction has
been given to it by statute is to enforce forfeitures under the
statute of 1538.</p>

<p>Dr (afterwards the Right Hon. Robert Joseph) Phillimore
succeeded his father as judge of the court from 1855 to 1875,
being succeeded by Mr Arthur Cohen, K.C. As Sir R. Phillimore
was also the last judge of the high court of admiralty, from 1867
(the date of his appointment to the high court) to 1875, the two
offices were, probably for the first time in history, held by the
same person. Dr Phillimore&rsquo;s patent had a grant of the &ldquo;place
or office of judge official and commissary of the court of admiralty
of the Cinque Ports, and their members and appurtenances,
and to be assistant to my lieutenant of Dover castle in all such
affairs and business concerning the said court of admiralty
wherein yourself and assistance shall be requisite and necessary.&rdquo;
Of old the court sat sometimes at Sandwich, sometimes at other
ports. But the regular place for the sitting of the court has for
a long time been, and still is, the aisle of St James&rsquo;s church,
Dover. For convenience the judge often sits at the royal courts
of justice. The office of marshal in the high court is represented
in this court by a serjeant, who also bears a silver oar. There
is a registrar, as in the high court. The appeal is to the king in
council, and is heard by the judicial committee of the privy
council. The court can hear appeals from the Cinque Ports
salvage commissioners, such appeals being final (Cinque Ports
Act 1821). Actions may be transferred to it, and appeals made
to it, from the county courts in all cases, arising within the
jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports as defined by that act. At the
solemn installation of the lord warden the judge as the next
principal officer installs him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span></p>

<p>The Cinque Ports from the earliest times claimed to be exempt
from the jurisdiction of the admiral of England. Their early
charters do not, like those of Bristol and other seaports, express
this exemption in terms. It seems to have been derived from
the general words of the charters which preserve their liberties
and privileges.</p>

<p>The lord warden&rsquo;s claim to prize was raised in, but not finally
decided by, the high court of admiralty in the &ldquo;Ooster Ems,&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">CINTRA<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span>, a town of central Portugal, in the district of Lisbon,
formerly included in the province of Estramadura; 17 m.
W.N.W. of Lisbon by the Lisbon-Caçem-Cintra railway, and
6 m. N. by E. of Cape da Roca, the westernmost promontory of
the European mainland. Pop. (1900) 5914. Cintra is magnificently
situated on the northern slope of the Serra da Cintra, a
rugged mountain mass, largely overgrown with pines, eucalyptus,
cork and other forest trees, above which the principal summits
rise in a succession of bare and jagged grey peaks; the highest
being Cruz Alta (1772 ft.), marked by an ancient stone cross,
and commanding a wonderful view southward over Lisbon and
the Tagus estuary, and north-westward over the Atlantic and
the plateau of Mafra. Few European towns possess equal
advantages of position and climate; and every educated
Portuguese is familiar with the verses in which the beauty of
Cintra is celebrated by Byron in <i>Childe Harold</i> (1812), and by
Camoens in the national epic <i>Os Lusiadas</i> (1572). One of the
highest points of the Serra is surmounted by the Palacio da Pena,
a fantastic imitation of a medieval fortress, built on the site of a
Hieronymite convent by the prince consort Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg
(d. 1885); while an adjacent part of the range is occupied
by the Castello des Mouros, an extensive Moorish fortification,
containing a small ruined mosque and a very curious set of
ancient cisterns. The lower slopes of the Serra are covered
with the gardens and villas of the wealthier inhabitants of
Lisbon, who migrate hither in spring and stay until late
autumn.</p>

<p>In the town itself the most conspicuous building is a 14th-15th-century
royal palace, partly Moorish, partly debased Gothic
in style, and remarkable for the two immense conical chimneys
which rise like towers in the midst. The 18th-century Palacio
de Seteaes, built in the French style then popular in Portugal,
is said to derive its name (&ldquo;Seven <i>Ahs</i>&rdquo;) from a sevenfold echo;
here, on the 22nd of August 1808, was signed the convention of
Cintra, by which the British and Portuguese allowed the French
army to evacuate the kingdom without molestation. Beside the
road which leads for 3½ m. W. to the village of Collares, celebrated
for its wine, is the Penha Verde, an interesting country house and
chapel, founded by João de Castro (1500-1548), fourth viceroy
of the Indies. De Castro also founded the convent of Santa Cruz,
better known as the Convento de Cortiça or Cork convent, which
stands at the western extremity of the Serra, and owes its name
to the cork panels which formerly lined its walls. Beyond the
Penha Verde, on the Collares road, are the palace and park of
Montserrate. The palace was originally built by William
Beckford, the novelist and traveller (1761-1844), and was
purchased in 1856 by Sir Francis Cook, an Englishman who
afterwards obtained the Portuguese title viscount of Montserrate.
The palace, which contains a valuable library, is built of pure
white stone, in Moorish style; its walls are elaborately sculptured.
The park, with its tropical luxuriance of vegetation and its variety
of lake, forest and mountain scenery, is by far the finest example
of landscape gardening in the Iberian Peninsula, and probably
among the finest in the world. Its high-lying lawns, which
overlook the Atlantic, are as perfect as any in England, and
there is one ravine containing a whole wood of giant tree-ferns
from New Zealand. Other rare plants have been systematically
collected and brought to Montserrate from all parts of the world
by Sir Francis Cook, and afterwards by his successor, Sir
Frederick Cook, the second viscount. The Praia das Maçãs, or
&ldquo;beach of apples,&rdquo; in the centre of a rich fruit-bearing valley,
is a favourite sea-bathing station, connected with Cintra by an
extension of the electric tramway which runs through the town.</p>

Heckford or Hugford, and under his second master, Antonio
Domenico Gabbiani, he became a very clever draughtsman.
He was in Rome from 1750 to 1753, where he became acquainted
with Sir William Chambers, the architect, and Joseph Wilton,
the sculptor, whom he accompanied to England in August 1755.
He had already painted two pictures for the abbey of San
Michele in Pelago, Pistoia, which had brought him reputation,
and on his arrival in England he was patronized by Lord Tilney,
the duke of Richmond and other noblemen. His acquaintance
with Sir William Chambers no doubt helped him on, for when
Chambers designed the Albany in London for Lord Holland,
Cipriani painted a ceiling for him. He also painted part of a
ceiling in Buckingham Palace, and a room with poetical subjects
at Standlynch in Wiltshire. Some of his best and most permanent
work was, however, done at Somerset House, built by his friend
Chambers, upon which he lavished infinite pains. He not only
prepared the decorations for the interior of the north block, but,
says Joseph Baretti in his <i>Guide through the Royal Academy</i>
(1780), &ldquo;the whole of the carvings in the various fronts of
Somerset Place&mdash;excepting Bacon&rsquo;s bronze figures&mdash;were carved
from finished drawings made by Cipriani.&rdquo; These designs
include the five masks forming the keystones to the arches on the
courtyard side of the vestibule, and the two above the doors
leading into the wings of the north block, all of which are believed
to have been carved by Nollekens. The grotesque groups
flanking the main doorways on three sides of the quadrangle
and the central doorway on the terrace appear also to have been
designed by Cipriani. The apartments in Sir William Chambers&rsquo;s
stately palace that were assigned to the Royal Academy, into
which it moved in 1780, owed much to Cipriani&rsquo;s graceful, if
mannered, pencil. The central panel of the library ceiling was
painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, but the four compartments
in the coves, representing Allegory, Fable, Nature and History,
were Cipriani&rsquo;s. These paintings still remain at Somerset House,
together with the emblematic painted ceiling, also his work, of
what was once the library of the Royal Society. It was natural
that Cipriani should thus devote himself to adorning the apartments
of the academy, since he was an original member (1768)
of that body, for which he designed the diploma so well engraved
by Bartolozzi. In recognition of his services in this respect the
members presented him in 1769 with a silver cup with a commemorative
inscription. He was much employed by the publishers,
for whom he made drawings in pen and ink, sometimes
coloured. His friend Bartolozzi engraved most of them. Drawings
by him are in both the British Museum and Victoria and
Albert Museum. His best autograph engravings are &ldquo;The Death
of Cleopatra,&rdquo; after Benvenuto Cellini; &ldquo;The Descent of the
Holy Ghost,&rdquo; after Gabbiani; and portraits for Hollis&rsquo;s memoirs,
1780. He painted allegorical designs for George III.&rsquo;s state
coach&mdash;which is still in use&mdash;in 1782, and repaired Verrio&rsquo;s
paintings at Windsor and Rubens&rsquo;s ceiling in the Banqueting
House at Whitehall. If his pictures were often weak, his decorative
treatment of children was usually exceedingly happy. Some
of his most pleasing work was that which, directly or indirectly,
he executed for the decoration of furniture. He designed many
groups of nymphs and <i>amorini</i> and medallion subjects to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
the centre of Pergolesi&rsquo;s bands of ornament, and they were
continually reproduced upon the elegant satin-wood furniture
which was growing popular in his later days and by the end of
the 18th century became a rage. Sometimes these designs were
inlaid in marqueterie, but most frequently they were painted
upon the satin-wood by other hands with delightful effect, since
in the whole range of English furniture there is nothing more
enchanting than really good finished satin-wood pieces. There
can be little doubt that some of the beautiful furniture designed
by the Adams was actually painted by Cipriani himself. He also
occasionally designed handles for drawers and doors. Cipriani
died at Hammersmith in 1785 and was buried at Chelsea, where
Bartolozzi erected a monument to his memory. He had married
an English lady, by whom he had two sons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRCAR<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span>, an Indian term applied to the component parts of a
<i>subah</i> or province, each of which is administered by a deputy-governor.
In English it is principally employed in the name
of the <span class="sc">Northern Circars</span>, used to designate a now obsolete
division of the Madras presidency, which consisted of a narrow
slip of territory lying along the western side of the Bay of Bengal
from 15° 40&prime; to 20° 17&prime; N. lat. These Northern Circars were
five in number, Chicacole, Rajahmundry, Ellore, Kondapalli
and Guntur, and their total area was about 30,000 sq. m.</p>

<p>The district corresponds in the main to the modern districts
of Kistna, Godavari, Vizagapatam, Ganjam and a part of
Nellore. It was first invaded by the Mahommedans in 1471;
in 1541 they conquered Kondapalli, and nine years later they
extended their conquests over all Guntur and the districts of
Masulipatam. But the invaders appear to have acquired only
an imperfect possession of the country, as it was again wrested
from the Hindu princes of Orissa about the year 1571, during
the reign of Ibrahim, of the Kutb Shahi dynasty of Hyderabad
or Golconda. In 1687 the Circars were added, along with the
empire of Hyderabad, to the extensive empire of Aurangzeb.
Salabat Jang, the son of the nizam ul mulk Asaf Jah, who was
indebted for his elevation to the throne to the French East
India Company, granted them in return for their services the
district of Kondavid or Guntur, and soon afterwards the other
Circars. In 1759, by the conquest of the fortress of Masulipatam,
the dominion of the maritime provinces on both sides, from the
river Gundlakamma to the Chilka lake, was necessarily transferred
from the French to the British. But the latter left them
under the administration of the nizam, with the exception of
the town and fortress of Masulipatam, which were retained by
the English East India Company. In 1765 Lord Clive obtained
from the Mogul emperor Shah Alam a grant of the five Circars.
Hereupon the fort of Kondapalli was seized by the British, and
on the 12th of November 1766 a treaty of alliance was signed
with Nizam Ali by which the Company, in return for the grant
of the Circars, undertook to maintain troops for the nizam&rsquo;s
assistance. By a second treaty, signed on the 1st of March
1768, the nizam acknowledged the validity of Shah Alam&rsquo;s
grant and resigned the Circars to the Company, receiving as a
mark of friendship an annuity of £50,000. Guntur, as the
personal estate of the nizam&rsquo;s brother Basalat Jang, was excepted
during his lifetime under both treaties. He died in 1782,
but it was not till 1788 that Guntur came under British administration.
Finally, in 1823, the claims of the nizam over the
Northern Circars were bought outright by the Company, and
they became a British possession.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRCASSIA<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span>, a name formerly given to the north-western
portion of the Caucasus, including the district between the
mountain range and the Black Sea, and extending to the north
of the central range as far as the river Kuban. Its physical
features are described in the article on the Russian province of
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kuban</a></span>, with which it approximately coincides. The present
article is confined to a consideration of the ethnographical
relations and characteristics of the people, their history being
treated under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caucasia</a></span>.</p>

<p>The Cherkesses or Circassians, who gave their name to this
region, of which they were until lately the sole inhabitants, are a
peculiar race, differing from the other tribes of the Caucasus in
origin and language. They designate themselves by the name
of Adigheb, that of Cherkesses being a term of Russian origin.
By their long-continued struggles with the power of Russia,
during a period of nearly forty years, they attracted the attention
of the other nations of Europe in a high degree, and were at the
same time an object of interest to the student of the history of
civilization, from the strange mixture which their customs
exhibited of chivalrous sentiment with savage customs. For
this reason it may be still worth while to give a brief summary
of their national characteristics and manners, though these
must now be regarded as in great measure things of the past.</p>

<p>In the patriarchal simplicity of their manners, the mental
qualities with which they were endowed, the beauty of form
and regularity of feature by which they were distinguished, they
surpassed most of the other tribes of the Caucasus. At the
same time they were remarkable for their warlike and intrepid
character, their independence, their hospitality to strangers,
and that love of country which they manifested in their determined
resistance to an almost overwhelming power during the
period of a long and desolating war. The government under
which they lived was a peculiar form of the feudal system. The
free Circassians were divided into three distinct ranks, the princes
or <i>pshi</i>, the nobles or <i>uork</i> (Tatar <i>usden</i>), and the
peasants or <i>hokotl</i>. Like the inhabitants of the other regions of the
Caucasus, they were also divided into numerous families, tribes
or clans, some of which were very powerful, and carried on war
against each other with great animosity. The slaves, of whom
a large proportion were prisoners of war, were generally employed
in the cultivation of the soil, or in the domestic service of some
of the principal chiefs.</p>

<p>The will of the people was acknowledged as the supreme
source of authority; and every free Circassian had a right to
express his opinion in those assemblies of his tribe in which the
questions of peace and war, almost the only subjects which
engaged their attention, were brought under deliberation. The
princes and nobles, the leaders of the people in war and their
rulers in peace, were only the administrators of a power which
was delegated to them. As they had no written laws, the
administration of justice was regulated solely by custom and
tradition, and in those tribes professing Mahommedanism by
the precepts of the Koran. The most aged and respected
inhabitants of the various <i>auls</i> or villages frequently sat in
judgment, and their decisions were received without a murmur
by the contending parties. The Circassian princes and nobles
were professedly Mahommedans; but in their religious services
many of the ceremonies of their former heathen and Christian
worship were still preserved. A great part of the people had
remained faithful to the worship of their ancient gods&mdash;Shible,
the god of thunder, of war and of justice; Tleps, the god of fire;
and Seosseres, the god of water and of winds. Although the
Circassians are said to have possessed minds capable of the
highest cultivation, the arts and sciences, with the exception
of poetry and music, were completely neglected. They possessed
no written language. The wisdom of their sages, the knowledge
they had acquired, and the memory of their warlike deeds were
preserved in verses, which were repeated from mouth to mouth
and descended from father to son.</p>

<p>The education of the young Circassian was confined to riding,
fencing, shooting, hunting, and such exercises as were calculated
to strengthen his frame and prepare him for a life of active
warfare. The only intellectual duty of the <i>atalik</i> or instructor,
with whom the young men lived until they had completed
their education, was that of teaching them to express their
thoughts shortly, quickly and appropriately. One of their
marriage ceremonies was very strange. The young man who
had been approved by the parents, and had paid the stipulated
price in money, horses, oxen, or sheep for his bride, was expected
to come with his friends fully armed, and to carry her off by force
from her father&rsquo;s house. Every free Circassian had unlimited
right over the lives of his wife and children. Although polygamy
was allowed by the laws of the Koran, the custom of the country
forbade it, and the Circassians were generally faithful to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
marriage bond. The respect for superior age was carried to
such an extent that the young brother used to rise from his seat
when the elder entered an apartment, and was silent when he
spoke. Like all the other inhabitants of the Caucasus, the
Circassians were distinguished for two very opposite qualities&mdash;the
most generous hospitality and implacable vindictiveness.
Hospitality to the stranger was considered one of the most
sacred duties. Whatever were his rank in life, all the members
of the family rose to receive him on his entrance, and conduct
him to the principal seat in the apartment. The host was considered
responsible with his own life for the security of his guest,
upon whom, even although his deadliest enemy, he would inflict
no injury while under the protection of his roof. The chief who
had received a stranger was also bound to grant him an escort
of horse to conduct him in safety on his journey, and confide
him to the protection of those nobles with whom he might be on
friendly terms. The law of vengeance was no less binding on
the Circassian. The individual who had slain any member of a
family was pursued with implacable vengeance by the relatives,
until his crime was expiated by death. The murderer might,
indeed, secure his safety by the payment of a certain sum of
money, or by carrying off from the house of his enemy a newly-born
child, bringing it up as his own, and restoring it when its
education was finished. In either case, the family of the slain
individual might discontinue the pursuit of vengeance without
any stain upon its honour. The man closely followed by his
enemy, who, on reaching the dwelling of a woman, had merely
touched her hand, was safe from all other pursuit so long as he
remained under the protection of her roof. The opinions of the
Circassians regarding theft resembled those of the ancient
Spartans. The commission of the crime was not considered so
disgraceful as its discovery; and the punishment of being
compelled publicly to restore the stolen property to its original
possessor, amid the derision of his tribe, was much dreaded by
the Circassian who would glory in a successful theft. The greatest
stain upon the Circassian character was the custom of selling
their children, the Circassian father being always willing to
part with his daughters, many of whom were bought by Turkish
merchants for the harems of Eastern monarchs. But no degradation
was implied in this transaction, and the young women
themselves were generally willing partners in it. Herds of cattle
and sheep constituted the chief riches of the inhabitants. The
princes and nobles, from whom the members of the various tribes
held the land which they cultivated, were the proprietors of the
soil. The Circassians carried on little or no commerce, and the
state of perpetual warfare in which they lived prevented them
from cultivating any of the arts of peace.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRCE<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Kirkê">&#922;&#943;&#961;&#954;&#951;</span>), in Greek legend, a famous sorceress, the
daughter of Helios and the ocean nymph Perse. Having
murdered her husband, the prince of Colchis, she was expelled
by her subjects and placed by her father on the solitary island
of Aeaea on the coast of Italy. She was able by means of drugs
and incantations to change human beings into the forms of
wolves or lions, and with these beings her palace was surrounded.
Here she was found by Odysseus and his companions; the
latter she changed into swine, but the hero, protected by the herb
<i>moly</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), which he had received from Hermes, not only forced her
to restore them to their original shape, but also gained her love.
For a year he relinquished himself to her endearments, and
when he determined to leave, she instructed him how to sail
to the land of shades which lay on the verge of the ocean stream,
in order to learn his fate from the prophet Teiresias. Upon his
return she also gave him directions for avoiding the dangers of
the journey home (Homer, <i>Odyssey</i>, x.-xii.; Hyginus, <i>Fab.</i>
125). The Roman poets associated her with the most ancient
traditions of Latium, and assigned her a home on the promontory
of Circei (Virgil, <i>Aeneid</i>, vii. 10). The metamorphoses of Scylla
and of Picus, king of the Ausonians, by Circe, are narrated in
Ovid (<i>Metamorphoses</i>, xiv.).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>The Myth of Kirke</i>, by R. Brown (1883), in which Circe is explained
as a moon-goddess of Babylonian origin, contains an exhaustive
summary of facts, although many of the author&rsquo;s speculations may
be proved untenable (review by H. Bradley in <i>Academy</i>, January 19,
1884); see also J.E. Harrison, <i>Myths of the Odyssey</i> (1882);

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIRCEIUS MONS<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (mod. <i>Monte Circeo</i>), an isolated promontory
on the S.W. coast of Italy, about 80 m. S.E. of Rome. It is a
ridge of limestone about 3½ m. long by 1 m. wide at the base,
running from E. to W. and surrounded by the sea on all sides
except the N. The land to the N. of it is 53 ft. above sea-level,
while the summit of the promontory is 1775 ft. The origin of
the name is uncertain: it has naturally been connected with the
legend of Circe, and Victor Bérard (in <i>Les Phéniciens et l&rsquo;Odyssée</i>,
ii. 261 seq.) maintains in support of the identification that <span class="grk" title="Ahiaiê">&#913;&#7984;&#945;&#943;&#951;</span>,
the Greek name for the island of Circe, is a faithful transliteration
of a Semitic name, meaning &ldquo;island of the hawk,&rdquo; of which
<span class="grk" title="nêsos Kirkês">&#957;&#8134;&#963;&#959;&#962; &#922;&#943;&#961;&#954;&#951;&#962;</span> is the translation. The difficulty has been raised,
especially by geologists, that the promontory ceased to be an
island at a period considerably before the time of Homer; but
Procopius very truly remarked that the promontory has all the
appearance of an island until one is actually upon it. Upon the
E. end of the ridge of the promontory are the remains of an
enceinte, forming roughly a rectangle of about 200 by 100 yds.
of very fine polygonal work, on the outside, the blocks being
very carefully cut and jointed and right angles being intentionally
avoided. The wall stands almost entirely free, as at Arpinum&mdash;polygonal
walls in Italy are as a rule embanking walls&mdash;and
increases considerably in thickness as it descends. The blocks
of the inner face are much less carefully worked both here and at
Arpinum. It seems to have been an acropolis, and contains no
traces of buildings, except for a subterranean cistern, circular,
with a beehive roof of converging blocks. The modern village
of S. Felice Circeo seems to occupy the site of the ancient town,
the citadel of which stood on the mountain top, for its medieval
walls rest upon ancient walls of Cyclopean work of less careful
construction than those of the citadel, and enclosing an area of
200 by 150 yds.</p>

<p>Circei was founded as a Roman colony at an early date&mdash;according
to some authorities in the time of Tarquinius Superbus,
but more probably about 390 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The existence of a previous
population, however, is very likely indicated by the revolt of
Circei in the middle of the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, so that it is doubtful
whether the walls described are to be attributed to the Romans
or the earlier Volscian inhabitants. At the end of the republic,
however, or at latest at the beginning of the imperial period,
the city of Circei was no longer at the E. end of the promontory,
but on the E. shores of the Lago di Paola (a lagoon&mdash;now a
considerable fishery&mdash;separated from the sea by a line of
sandhills and connected with it by a channel of Roman date:
Strabo speaks of it as a small harbour) one mile N. of the W.
end of the promontory. Here are the remains of a Roman town,
belonging to the 1st and 2nd centuries, extending over an area
of some 600 by 500 yards, and consisting of fine buildings along
the lagoons, including a large open <i>piscina</i> or basin, surrounded
by a double portico, while farther inland are several very large
and well-preserved water-reservoirs, supplied by an aqueduct
of which traces may still be seen. An inscription speaks of an
amphitheatre, of which no remains are visible. The transference
of the city did not, however, mean the abandonment of the E.
end of the promontory, on which stand the remains of several
very large villas. An inscription, indeed, cut in the rock near
S. Felice, speaks of this part of the <i>promunturium Veneris</i> (the
only case of the use of this name) as belonging to the city of
Circei. On the S. and N. sides of the promontory there are
comparatively few buildings, while, at the W. end there is a
sheer precipice to the sea. The town only acquired municipal
rights after the Social War, and was a place of little importance,
except as a seaside resort. For its villas Cicero compares it
with Antium, and probably both Tiberius and Domitian possessed
residences there. The beetroot and oysters of Circei had a
certain reputation. The view from the highest summit of the
promontory (which is occupied by ruins of a platform attributed
with great probability to a temple of Venus or Circe) is of remarkable
beauty; the whole mountain is covered with fragrant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
shrubs. From any point in the Pomptine Marshes or on the
coast-line of Latium the Circeian promontory dominates the
landscape in the most remarkable way.</p>

<span class="grk" title="krikos">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>), a plane curve definable as the locus of a point which

<p>The form of a circle is familiar to all; and we proceed to define
certain lines, points, &amp;c., which constantly occur in studying
its geometry. The fixed point in the preceding definition is
termed the &ldquo;centre&rdquo; (C in fig. 1); the constant distance, <i>e.g.</i>
CG, the &ldquo;radius.&rdquo; The curve itself is sometimes termed the
&ldquo;circumference.&rdquo; Any line through the centre and terminated
at both extremities by the curve, <i>e.g.</i> AB, is a &ldquo;diameter&rdquo;;
any other line similarly terminated, <i>e.g.</i> EF, a &ldquo;chord.&rdquo; Any
line drawn from an external point to cut the circle in two points,
<i>e.g.</i> DEF, is termed a &ldquo;secant&rdquo;; if it touches the circle, <i>e.g.</i>
DG, it is a &ldquo;tangent.&rdquo; Any portion of the circumference
terminated by two points, <i>e.g.</i> AD (fig. 2), is termed an &ldquo;arc&rdquo;;
and the plane figure enclosed by a chord and arc, <i>e.g.</i> ABD, is
termed a &ldquo;segment&rdquo;;
if the chord be a diameter,
the segment
is termed a &ldquo;semicircle.&rdquo;
The figure
included by two radii
and an arc is a
&ldquo;sector,&rdquo; <i>e.g.</i> ECF
(fig. 2). &ldquo;Concentric
circles&rdquo; are, as the
name obviously
shows, circles having
the same centre; the
figure enclosed by the
circumferences of two
concentric circles is
an &ldquo;annulus&rdquo; (fig. 3),
and of two non-concentric
circles a &ldquo;lune,&rdquo; the shaded portions in fig. 4; the
clear figure is sometimes termed a &ldquo;lens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The circle was undoubtedly known to the early civilizations,
its simplicity specially recommending it as an object for study.
Euclid defines it (Book I. def. 15) as a &ldquo;plane figure enclosed
by one line, all the straight lines drawn to which from one point
within the figure are equal to one another.&rdquo; In the succeeding
three definitions the centre, diameter and the semicircle are
defined, while the third postulate of the same book demands
the possibility of describing a circle for every &ldquo;centre&rdquo; and
&ldquo;distance.&rdquo; Having employed the circle for the construction
and demonstration of several propositions in Books I. and II.
Euclid devotes his third book entirely to theorems and problems
relating to the circle, and certain lines and angles, which he
defines in introducing the propositions. The fourth book deals
with the circle in its relations to inscribed and circumscribed
triangles, quadrilaterals and regular polygons. Reference
should be made to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry</a></span>: <i>Euclidean</i>, for a
detailed summary of the Euclidean treatment, and the elementary
properties of the circle.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Analytical Geometry of the Circle.</i></p>

<p>In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry</a></span>: <i>Analytical</i>, it is shown that the
general equation to a circle in rectangular Cartesian co-ordinates
is x<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span> + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, <i>i.e.</i> in the general equation
of the second degree the co-efficients of x<span class="sp">2</span> and y<span class="sp">2</span> are
<span class="sidenote">Cartesian co-ordinates.</span>
equal, and of xy zero.    The co-ordinates of its centre
are -g/c, -f/c;   and  its  radius  is  (g<span class="sp">2</span> + f<span class="sp">2</span> - c)<span class="sp">½</span>. The
equations to the chord, tangent and normal are readily derived
by the ordinary methods.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Consider the two circles:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">x<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span> + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0,&emsp; x<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span> + 2g&prime;x + 2f&prime;y + c&rsquo; = 0.</p>

<p class="noind">Obviously these equations show that the curves intersect in
four points, two of which lie on the intersection of the line,
2(g - g&prime;)x + 2(f - f&prime;)y + c - c&prime; = 0, the radical axis, with the circles, and
the other two where the lines x² + y² = (x + iy) (x - iy) = 0 (where
i = &radic;-1) intersect the circles. The first pair of intersections may
be either real or imaginary; we proceed to discuss the second pair.</p>

<p>The equation x² + y² = 0 denotes a pair of perpendicular imaginary
lines; it follows, therefore, that circles always intersect in two
imaginary points at infinity along these lines, and since the terms
x² + y² occur in the equation of every circle, it is seen that all circles
pass through two fixed points at infinity. The introduction of these
lines and points constitutes a striking achievement in geometry,
and from their association with circles they have been named
the &ldquo;circular lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;circular points.&rdquo; Other names for the
circular lines are &ldquo;circulars&rdquo; or &ldquo;isotropic lines.&rdquo; Since the
equation to a circle of zero radius is x² + y² = 0, <i>i.e.</i> identical with the
circular lines, it follows that this circle consists of a real point and the
two imaginary lines; conversely, the circular lines are both a pair
of lines and a circle. A further deduction from the principle of
continuity follows by considering the intersections of concentric
circles. The equations to such circles may be expressed in the form
x² + y² = &alpha;², x² + y² = &beta;². These equations show that the circles touch
where they intersect the lines x² + y² = 0, <i>i.e.</i> concentric circles have
double contact at the circular points, the chord of contact being the
line at infinity.</p>
</div>

<p>In various systems of triangular co-ordinates the equations
to circles specially related to the triangle of reference assume
comparatively simple forms; consequently they provide elegant
algebraical demonstrations of properties concerning a triangle
and the circles intimately associated with its geometry. In this
article the equations to the more important circles&mdash;the circumscribed,
inscribed, escribed, self-conjugate&mdash;will be given;
reference should be made to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Triangle</a></span> for the consideration
of other circles (nine-point, Brocard, Lemoine, &amp;c.);
while in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry</a></span>: <i>Analytical</i>, the principles of the
different systems are discussed.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p>The equation to the circumcircle assumes the simple form
a&beta;&gamma; + b&gamma;&alpha; + c&alpha;&beta; = 0, the centre being cos A, cos B, cos C. The inscribed
circle is cos ½A &radic;(&alpha;)  cos ½B &radic;(&beta;) + cos ½C &radic;(&gamma;) = 0, with centre
&alpha; = &beta; = &gamma;; while the escribed circle opposite the angle A
<span class="sidenote">Trilinear co-ordinates.</span>
is cos ½A &radic;(-&alpha;) + sin ½B &radic;(&beta;) + sin ½C &radic;(&gamma;) = 0, with centre
-&alpha; = &beta; = &gamma;. The self-conjugate circle is &alpha;² sin 2A + &beta;² sin 2B
+ &gamma;² sin 2C = 0, or the equivalent form a cosA &alpha;²
+ b cos B &beta;² + c cos C &gamma;² = 0,
the centre being sec A, sec B, sec C.</p>

<p>The general equation to the circle in trilinear co-ordinates is readily
deduced from the fact that the circle is the only curve which intersects
the line infinity in the circular points.   Consider the equation</p>

<p class="center">a&beta;&gamma; + b&gamma;&alpha; + C&alpha;&beta; + (l&alpha; + m&beta; + n&gamma;) (a&alpha; + b&beta; + c&gamma;) = 0&emsp;&emsp;(1).</p>

<p>This obviously represents a conic intersecting the circle a&beta;&gamma; + b&gamma;&alpha;
+ c&alpha;&beta; = 0 in points on the common chords l&alpha; + m&beta; + n&gamma; = 0, a&alpha; + b&beta;
+ c&gamma; = 0. The line l&alpha; + m&beta; + n&gamma; is the radical axis, and since a&alpha; + b&beta;
+ c&gamma; = 0 is the line infinity, it is obvious that equation (1) represents
a conic passing through the circular points, <i>i.e.</i> a circle. If we
compare (1) with the general equation of the second degree
u&alpha;² + v&beta;² + w&gamma;² + 2u&prime;&beta;&gamma; + 2v&prime;&gamma;&alpha; + 2w&prime;&alpha;&beta; = 0, it is readily seen that for
this equation to represent a circle we must have</p>

<p class="center">-kabc = vc² + wb² - 2u&prime;bc = wa² + uc² - 2v&prime;ca = ub² + va² - 2w&prime;ab.</p>

<p>The corresponding equations in areal co-ordinates are readily
derived by substituting x/a, y/b, z/c for &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma; respectively in
the trilinear equations. The circumcircle is thus seen
<span class="sidenote">Areal co-ordinates.</span>
to be a²yz + b²zx + c²xy = 0, with centre sin 2A, sin 2B,
sin 2C; the inscribed circle is &radic;(x cot ½A) + &radic;(y cot ½B)
+ &radic;(z cot ½C) = 0, with centre sin A, sin B, sin C; the
escribed circle opposite the angle A is &radic;(-x cot ½A) + &radic;(y tan ½B)
+ &radic;(z tan ½C)=0, with centre - sin A, sin B, sin C; and the self-conjugate
circle is x² cot A + y² cot B + z² cot C = 0, with centre tan A,
tan B, tan C. Since in areal co-ordinates the line infinity is represented
by the equation x + y + z = 0 it is seen that every circle is
of the form a²yz + b²zx + c²xy + (lx + my + nz)(x + y + z) = 0. Comparing
this equation with ux² + vy² + wz² + 2u&prime;yz + 2v&prime;zx + 2w&prime;xy = 0, we
obtain as the condition for the general equation of the second degree
to represent a circle:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(v + w - 2u&prime;)/a² = (w + u - 2v&prime;)/b² = (u + v - 2w&prime;)/c².</p>

<p>In tangential (p, q, r) co-ordinates the inscribed circle has for its
equation (s - a)qr + (s - b)rp + (s - c)pq = 0, s being equal to ½(a + b + c);
an alternative form is qr cot ½A + rp cot ½B + pq cot ½C = 0;
the centre is ap + bq + cr = 0, or p sin A + q sin B + r sin C = 0.
<span class="sidenote">Tangential co-ordinates.</span>
The escribed circle opposite the angle A is -sqr + (s - c)rp
+ (s - b)pq = 0 or -qr cot ½A + rp tan ½B + pq tan ½C = 0, with
centre -ap + bq + cr = 0. The circumcircle is a &radic;(p) + b &radic;(q) + c &radic;(r) = 0,
the centre being p sin 2A + q sin 2B + r sin 2C = 0. The general
equation to a circle in this system of co-ordinates is deduced as
follows: If &rho; be the radius and lp + mq  + nr = 0 the centre, we have
&rho; = (lp<span class="su">1</span> - mq<span class="su">1</span> + nr<span class="su">1</span>/(l + m + n), in which p<span class="su">1</span>, q<span class="su">1</span>, r<span class="su">1</span> is a line distant &rho;
from the point lp + mq + nr = 0. Making this equation homogeneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
by the relation &Sigma;a²(p - q) (p - r) = 4&Delta;² (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry</a></span>: <i>Analytical</i>),
which is generally written {ap, bq, cr}² = 4&Delta;², we obtain
{ap, bq, cr}²&rho;² = 4&Delta;² {(lp + mq + nr)/(l + m + n)}², the accents being
dropped, and p, q, r regarded as current co-ordinates. This equation,
which may be more conveniently written {ap, bq, cr}²
= (&lambda;p + &mu;q + &nu;r)², obviously represents a circle,
the centre being &lambda;p + &mu;q + &nu;r = 0,
and radius 2&Delta;/(&lambda; + &mu; + &nu;).
If we make &lambda; = &mu; = &nu; = 0,
&rho; is infinite, and we obtain {ap, bq, cr}² = 0 as the equation to the
circular points.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Systems of Circles.</i></p>

<p><i>Centres and Circle of Similitude.</i>&mdash;The &ldquo;centres of similitude&rdquo;
of two circles may be defined as the intersections of the common
tangents to the two circles, the direct common tangents giving
rise to the &ldquo;external centre,&rdquo; the transverse tangents to the
&ldquo;internal centre.&rdquo; It may be readily shown that the external
and internal centres are the points where the line joining the
centres of the two circles is divided externally and internally in
the ratio of their radii.</p>

<p>The circle on the line joining the internal and external centres
of similitude as diameter is named the &ldquo;circle of similitude.&rdquo;
It may be shown to be the locus of the vertex of the triangle
which has for its base the distance between the centres of the
circles and the ratio of the remaining sides equal to the ratio of the
radii of the two circles.</p>

<p>With a system of three circles it is readily seen that there
are six centres of similitude, viz. two for each pair of circles,
and it may be shown that these lie three by three on four lines,
named the &ldquo;axes of similitude.&rdquo; The collinear centres are the
three sets of one external and two internal centres, and the three
external centres.</p>

<p><i>Coaxal Circles.</i>&mdash;A system of circles is coaxal when the locus
of points from which tangents to the circles are equal is a straight
line. Consider the case of two circles, and in the first place
suppose them to intersect in two real points A and B. Then by
Euclid iii. 36 it is seen that the line joining the points A and B is
the locus of the intersection of equal tangents, for if P be any
point on AB and PC and PD the tangents to the circles, then
PA·PB = PC² = PD², and therefore PC = PD. Furthermore it is
seen that AB is perpendicular to the line joining the centres,
and divides it in the ratio of the squares of the radii. The line
AB is termed the &ldquo;radical axis.&rdquo; A system coaxal with the two
given circles is readily constructed by describing circles through
the common points on the radical axis and any third point;
the minimum circle of the system is obviously that which has
the common chord of intersection for diameter, the maximum
is the radical axis&mdash;considered as
a circle of infinite radius. In the
case of two non-intersecting circles
it may be shown that the radical
axis has the same metrical relations
to the line of centres.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<div style="float: left;" class="figleft1">
<img style="border:0; width:350px; height:328px"
     src="images/img383.jpg"
     alt="" />
</div>

<p>There are several methods of constructing
the radical axis in this case.
One of the simplest is: Let P and P&prime;
(fig. 5) be the points of contact of
a common tangent; drop perpendiculars
PL, P&prime;L&prime;, from P and P&rsquo;
to OO&prime;, the line joining the centres,
then the radical axis bisects LL&rsquo; (at X) and is perpendicular to OO&prime;.
To prove this let AB, AB¹ be the tangents from any point on the
line AX. Then by Euc. i. 47, AB² = AO² - OB² = AX² + OX² + OP²;
and OX² = OD² - DX² = OP² + PD² - DX². Therefore AB² = AX²
 - DX² + PD². Similarly AB&prime;² = AX² - DX² + DP&prime;². Since PD = PD&prime;,
it follows that AB = AB&prime;.</p>

<p>To construct circles coaxal with the two given circles, draw the
tangent, say XR, from X, the point where the radical axis intersects
the line of centres, to one of the given circles, and with centre X and
radius XR describe a circle. Then circles having the intersections of
tangents to this circle and the line of centres for centres, and the
lengths of the tangents as radii, are members of the coaxal system.</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of non-intersecting circles, it is seen that the
minimum circles of the coaxal system are a pair of points I and I&prime;,
where the orthogonal circle to the system intersects the line of
centres; these points are named the &ldquo;limiting points.&rdquo; In the
case of a coaxal system having real points of intersection the
limiting  points are imaginary. Analytically, the Cartesian
equation to a coaxal system can be written in the form
x² + y² + 2ax ± k² = 0, where a varies from member to member,
while k is a constant. The radical axis is x = 0, and it may be
shown that the length of the tangent from a point (0, h) is
h² ± k², <i>i.e.</i> it is independent of a, and therefore of any particular
member of the system. The circles intersect in real or imaginary
points according to the lower or upper sign of k², and the limiting
points are real for the upper sign and imaginary for the lower sign.
The fundamental properties of coaxal systems may be summarized:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. The centres of circles forming a coaxal system are collinear;</p>

<p>2. A coaxal system having real points of intersection has imaginary
limiting points;</p>

<p>3. A coaxal system having imaginary points of intersection has
real limiting points;</p>

<p>4. Every circle through the limiting points cuts all circles of the
system orthogonally;</p>

<p>5. The limiting points are inverse points for every circle of the
system.</p>
</div>

<p>The theory of centres of similitude and coaxal circles affords
elegant demonstrations of the famous problem: To describe a
circle to touch three given circles. This problem, also termed
the &ldquo;Apollonian problem,&rdquo; was demonstrated with the aid of
conic sections by Apollonius in his book on <i>Contacts</i> or <i>Tangencies</i>;
geometrical solutions involving the conic sections were also given
by Adrianus Romanus, Vieta, Newton and others. The earliest
analytical solution appears to have been given by the princess
Elizabeth, a pupil of Descartes and daughter of Frederick V.
John Casey, professor of mathematics at the Catholic university
of Dublin, has given elementary demonstrations founded on
the theory of similitude and coaxal circles which are reproduced
in his <i>Sequel to Euclid</i>; an analytical solution by Gergonne is
given in Salmon&rsquo;s <i>Conic Sections</i>. Here we may notice that
there are eight circles which solve the problem.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Mensuration of the Circle.</i></p>

<p>All exact relations pertaining to the mensuration of the circle
involve the ratio of the circumference to the diameter. This
ratio, invariably denoted by &pi;, is constant for all circles, but
it does not admit of exact arithmetical expression, being of the
nature of an incommensurable number. Very early in the history
of geometry it was known that the circumference and area of a
circle of radius r could be expressed in the forms 2&pi;r and &pi;r².
The exact geometrical evaluation of the second quantity, viz.
&pi;r², which, in reality, is equivalent to determining a square
equal in area to a circle, engaged the attention of mathematicians
for many centuries. The history of these attempts, together
with modern contributions to our knowledge of the value and
nature of the number &pi;, is given below (<i>Squaring of the Circle</i>).</p>

<p>A synopsis of the leading formula connected with the circle will
now be given.</p>

<p>1. <i>Circle.</i>&mdash;Data: radius = a. &emsp;Circumference = 2&pi;a. &emsp;Area = &pi;a².</p>

<p>2. <i>Arc</i> and <i>Sector</i>.&mdash;Data: radius = a; &theta; = circular measure of

semi-arc; c<span class="su">4</span> = chord of quarter-arc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span></p>

<p>Exact formulae are:&mdash;Arc = a&theta;, where &theta; may be given directly,
or indirectly by the relation c = 2a sin ½&theta;. Area of sector = ½a²&theta;
= ½ radius &times; arc.</p>

<p>Approximate formulae are:&mdash;Arc = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>(8c<span class="su">2</span> - c) (Huygen&rsquo;s formula);

<p>Exact formulae are:&mdash;Area = ½a²(&theta; - sin &theta;) = ½a²&theta; - ¼c² cot ½&theta;

<p>From these results the mensuration of any figure bounded by

<p class="center1"><i>Squaring of the Circle.</i></p>

<p>The problem of finding a square equal in area to a given circle,
like all problems, may be increased in difficulty by the imposition
of restrictions; consequently under the designation there may
be embraced quite a variety of geometrical problems. It has
to be noted, however, that, when the &ldquo;squaring&rdquo; of the circle
is especially spoken of, it is almost always tacitly assumed that
the restrictions are those of the Euclidean geometry.</p>

<p>Since the area of a circle equals that of the rectilineal triangle
whose base has the same length as the circumference and whose
altitude equals the radius (Archimedes, <span class="grk" title="Kyklou metrêsis">&#922;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, prop. 1),
it follows that, if a straight line could be drawn equal in length
to the circumference, the required square could be found by
an ordinary Euclidean construction; also, it is evident that,
conversely, if a square equal in area to the circle could be obtained
it would be possible to draw a straight line equal to the circumference.
Rectification and quadrature of the circle have thus been,
since the time of Archimedes at least, practically identical
problems. Again, since the circumferences of circles are proportional
to their diameters&mdash;a proposition assumed to be true
from the dawn almost of practical geometry&mdash;the rectification
of the circle is seen to be transformable into finding the ratio of
the circumference to the diameter. This correlative numerical
problem and the two purely geometrical problems are inseparably
connected historically.</p>

<p>Probably the earliest value for the ratio was 3. It was so
among the Jews (1 Kings vii. 23, 26), the Babylonians (Oppert,
<i>Journ. asiatique</i>, August 1872, October 1874), the Chinese (Biot,
<i>Journ. asiatique</i>, June 1841), and probably also the Greeks.
Among the ancient Egyptians, as would appear from a calculation
in the Rhind papyrus, the number (<span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>)<span class="sp">4</span>, <i>i.e.</i> 3.1605, was at one
time in use.<a name="FnAnchor_1b" id="FnAnchor_1b" href="#Footnote_1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The first attempts to solve the purely geometrical
problem appear to have been made by the Greeks (Anaxagoras,
&amp;c.)<a name="FnAnchor_2b" id="FnAnchor_2b" href="#Footnote_2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a>, one of whom, Hippocrates, doubtless raised hopes of a
solution by his quadrature of the so-called <i>meniscoi</i> or <i>lune</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_3b" id="FnAnchor_3b" href="#Footnote_3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>[The Greeks were in possession of several relations pertaining
to the quadrature of the lune. The following are among the more
interesting. In fig. 6, ABC is an isosceles triangle right
angled at C, ADB is the semicircle described on AB as diameter,
AEB the circular arc described with centre C and radius
CA = CB. It is easily shown that the areas of the lune ADBEA
and the triangle ABC are equal. In fig. 7, ABC is any triangle
right angled at C, semicircles are described on the three sides,
thus forming two lunes AFCDA and CGBEC. The sum of the
areas of these lunes equals the area of the triangle ABC.]</p>

<p>As for Euclid, it is sufficient to recall the facts that the original
author of prop. 8 of book iv. had strict proof of the ratio being
&lt; 4, and the author of prop. 15 of the ratio being &gt; 3, and to
direct attention to the importance of book x. on incommensurables
and props. 2 and 16 of book xii., viz. that &ldquo;circles are to
one another as the squares on their diameters&rdquo; and that &ldquo;in
the greater of two concentric circles a regular 2n-gon can be
inscribed which shall not meet the circumference of the less,&rdquo;
however nearly equal the circles may be.</p>

</div>

<p>With Archimedes (287-212 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) a notable advance was made.
Taking the circumference as intermediate between the perimeters
of the inscribed and the circumscribed regular n-gons, he showed
that, the radius of the circle being given and the perimeter of
some particular circumscribed regular polygon obtainable, the
perimeter of the circumscribed regular polygon of double the
number of sides could be calculated; that the like was true of
the inscribed polygons; and that consequently a means was
thus afforded of approximating to the
circumference of the circle. As a
matter of fact, he started with a semi-side
AB of a circumscribed regular
hexagon meeting the circle in B (see
fig. 8), joined A and B with O the
centre, bisected the angle AOB by
OD, so that BD became the semi-side of a circumscribed regular
12-gon; then as AB:BO:OA::1: &radic;3:2 he sought an approximation
to &radic;3 and found that AB:BO &gt; 153:265. Next
he applied his theorem<a name="FnAnchor_4b" id="FnAnchor_4b" href="#Footnote_4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> BO + OA:AB::OB:BD to calculate
BD; from this in turn he calculated the semi-sides of the
circumscribed regular 24-gon, 48-gon and 96-gon, and so finally
established for the circumscribed regular 96-gon that
perimeter:diameter &lt; 3<span class="sp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="su">7</span>:1. In a quite analogous manner he proved for
the inscribed regular 96-gon that perimeter:diameter &gt; 3<span class="sp">10</span>&frasl;<span class="su">71</span>:1.
The conclusion from these therefore was that the ratio of circumference
to diameter is &lt; 3<span class="sp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="su">7</span> and &gt; 3<span class="sp">10</span>&frasl;<span class="su">71</span>. This is a most notable
piece of work; the immature condition of arithmetic at the time
was the only real obstacle preventing the evaluation of the ratio
to any degree of accuracy whatever.<a name="FnAnchor_5b" id="FnAnchor_5b" href="#Footnote_5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>No advance of any importance was made upon the achievement
of Archimedes until after the revival of learning. His
immediate successors may have used his method to attain a
greater degree of accuracy, but there is very little evidence
pointing in this direction. Ptolemy (fl. 127-151), in the <i>Great
Syntaxis</i>, gives 3.141552 as the ratio<a name="FnAnchor_6b" id="FnAnchor_6b" href="#Footnote_6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a>; and the Hindus
(c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 500), who were very probably indebted to the Greeks,
used <span class="spp">62832</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20000</span>, that is, the now familiar 3.1416.<a name="FnAnchor_7b" id="FnAnchor_7b" href="#Footnote_7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>It was not until the 15th century that attention in Europe
began to be once more directed to the subject, and after the
resuscitation a considerable length of time elapsed before any
progress was made. The first advance in accuracy was due to a
certain Adrian, son of Anthony, a native of Metz (1527), and
father of the better-known Adrian Metius of Alkmaar. In
refutation of Duchesne(Van der Eycke), he showed that the ratio
was &lt; 3<span class="spp">17</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">120</span> and &gt; 3<span class="spp">15</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">106</span>, and thence made the exceedingly lucky
step of taking a mean between the two by the quite unjustifiable
process of halving the sum of the two numerators for a new
numerator and halving the sum of the two denominators for
a new denominator, thus arriving at the now well-known approximation
3<span class="spp">16</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">113</span> or <span class="spp">335</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">113</span>, which, being equal to 3.1415929...,
is correct to the sixth fractional place.<a name="FnAnchor_8b" id="FnAnchor_8b" href="#Footnote_8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span></p>

<p>The next to advance the calculation was Francisco Vieta.
By finding the perimeter of the inscribed and that of the circumscribed
regular polygon of 393216 (<i>i.e.</i> 6 &times; 2<span class="sp">16</span>) sides, he proved
that the ratio was &gt; 3.1415926535 and &lt; 3.1415926537, so that
its value became known (in 1579) correctly to 10 fractional places.
The theorem for angle-bisection which Vieta used was not that
of Archimedes, but that which would now appear in the form
1 - cos &theta; = 2 sin² ½&theta;. With Vieta, by reason of the advance in
arithmetic, the style of treatment becomes more strictly trigonometrical;
indeed, the <i>Universales Inspectiones</i>, in which the
calculation occurs, would now be called plane and spherical
trigonometry, and the accompanying <i>Canon mathematicus</i> a
table of sines, tangents and secants.<a name="FnAnchor_9b" id="FnAnchor_9b" href="#Footnote_9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a> Further, in comparing
the labours of Archimedes and Vieta, the effect of increased
power of symbolical expression is very noticeable. Archimedes&rsquo;s
process of unending cycles of arithmetical operations could at
best have been expressed in his time by a &ldquo;rule&rdquo; in words; in
the 16th century it could be condensed into a &ldquo;formula.&rdquo;
Accordingly, we find in Vieta a formula for the ratio of diameter
to circumference, viz. the interminate product<a name="FnAnchor_10b" id="FnAnchor_10b" href="#Footnote_10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">½&radic;<span class="ov">½</span> · &radic;<span class="ov">½ + ½&radic;½</span> · &radic;<span class="tb">½ + ½&radic;<span class="ov">(½ + ½&radic;½)</span></span> ...</p>

<p>From this point onwards, therefore, no knowledge whatever
of geometry was necessary in any one who aspired to determine
the ratio to any required degree of accuracy; the problem
being reduced to an arithmetical computation. Thus in connexion
with the subject a genus of workers became possible who may
be styled &ldquo;&pi;-computers or circle-squarers&rdquo;&mdash;a name which, if
it connotes anything uncomplimentary, does so because of the
almost entirely fruitless character of their labours. Passing over
Adriaan van Roomen (Adrianus Romanus) of Louvain, who
published the value of the ratio correct to 15 places in his <i>Idea
mathematica</i> (1593),<a name="FnAnchor_11b" id="FnAnchor_11b" href="#Footnote_11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a> we come to the notable computer Ludolph
van Ceulen (d. 1610), a native of Germany, long resident in
Holland. His book, <i>Van den Circkel</i> (Delft, 1596), gave the ratio
correct to 20 places, but he continued his calculations as long
as he lived, and his best result was published on his tombstone
in St Peter&rsquo;s church, Leiden. The inscription, which is not
known to be now in existence,<a name="FnAnchor_12b" id="FnAnchor_12b" href="#Footnote_12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a> is in part as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>This gives the ratio correct to 35 places. Van Ceulen&rsquo;s process
was essentially identical with that of Vieta. Its numerous root
extractions amply justify a stronger expression than &ldquo;multo
labore,&rdquo; especially in an epitaph. In Germany the &ldquo;Ludolphische
Zahl&rdquo; (Ludolph&rsquo;s number) is still a common name for the ratio.<a name="FnAnchor_13b" id="FnAnchor_13b" href="#Footnote_13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>Up to this point the credit of most that had been done may be
set down to Archimedes. A new departure, however, was made
by Willebrord Snell of Leiden
in his <i>Cyclometria</i>, published
in 1621. His achievement
was a closely approximate
geometrical solution of the
problem of rectification (see
fig. 9): ACB being a semicircle
whose centre is O, and AC the arc to be rectified, he produced
AB to D,  making BD equal to the radius, joined DC,
and produced it to meet the tangent at A in E; and then his
assertion (not established by him) was that AE was nearly equal
to the arc AC, the error being in defect. For the purposes of
the calculator a solution erring in excess was also required, and
this Snell gave by slightly varying the former construction.
Instead of producing AB
(see fig. 10) so that BD was

<span style="float: right;" class="figright1">
<img style="border:0; width:300px; height:132px"
     src="images/img385b.jpg"
     alt="" />
</span>

equal to r, he produced it
only so far that, when the
extremity D&prime; was joined with
C, the part D&prime;F outside the
circle was equal to r; in
other words, by a non-Euclidean construction he trisected the
angle AOC, for it is readily seen that, since FD&prime; = FO = OC, the
angle FOB = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>AOC.<a name="FnAnchor_14b" id="FnAnchor_14b" href="#Footnote_14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a> This couplet of constructions is as important
from the calculator&rsquo;s point of view as it is interesting
geometrically. To compare it on this score with the fundamental
proposition of Archimedes, the latter must be put into a form
similar to Snell&rsquo;s. AMC being an arc of a circle (see fig. 11)
whose centre is O, AC its chord, and HK the tangent drawn at
the middle point of the arc and bounded by OA, OC produced,
then, according to Archimedes, AMC &lt; HK, but &gt; AC. In
modern trigonometrical notation the propositions to be compared
stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">2 tan ½&theta; &gt; &theta;  &gt; 2 sin ½&theta; &emsp;&emsp;(Archimedes);</p>

<p>As might be expected, a fresh view of the matter was taken
by René Descartes. The problem he set himself was the exact
converse of that of Archimedes. A given straight line being
viewed as equal in length to the circumference of a circle, he
sought to find the diameter of the circle. His construction is
as follows (see fig. 12). Take AB equal to one-fourth of the given
line; on AB describe a square ABCD; join AC; in AC produced
find, by a known process, a point C<span class="su">1</span> such that, when C<span class="su">1</span>B<span class="su">1</span> is
drawn perpendicular to AB produced and C<span class="su">1</span>D<span class="su">1</span> perpendicular
to BC produced, the rectangle BC<span class="su">1</span> will be equal to ¼ABCD; by
the same process find a point C<span class="su">2</span> such that the rectangle B<span class="su">1</span>C<span class="su">2</span> will
be equal to ¼BC<span class="su">1</span>; and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. The diameter sought
is the straight line from A to the limiting position of the series of
B&rsquo;s, say the straight line AB<span class="su">&infin;</span>. As in the case of the process of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
Archimedes, we may direct our attention either to the infinite
series of geometrical operations or to the corresponding infinite
series of arithmetical operations. Denoting the number of units
in AB by ¼c, we can express BB<span class="su">1</span>, B<span class="su">1</span>B<span class="su">2</span>, ... in terms of ¼c, and
the identity AB<span class="su">&infin;</span> = AB + BB<span class="su">1</span> + B<span class="su">1</span>B<span class="su">2</span> + ... gives us at once
an expression for the diameter in terms of the circumference by
means of an infinite series.<a name="FnAnchor_17b" id="FnAnchor_17b" href="#Footnote_17b"><span class="sp">17</span></a> The proof of the correctness of the
construction is seen to be involved in the following theorem,
which serves likewise to throw new light on the subject:&mdash;AB
being any straight line whatever, and the above construction
being made, then AB is the diameter of the circle circumscribed
by the square ABCD (self-evident), AB<span class="su">1</span> is the diameter of the
circle circumscribed by the regular 8-gon having the same
perimeter as the square, AB<span class="su">2</span> is the diameter of the circle circumscribed
by the regular 16-gon having the same perimeter as the
square, and so on. Essentially, therefore, Descartes&rsquo;s process
is that known later as the process of <i>isoperimeters</i>, and often
attributed wholly to Schwab.<a name="FnAnchor_18b" id="FnAnchor_18b" href="#Footnote_18b"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>

<p>In 1655 appeared the <i>Arithmetica Infinitorum</i> of John Wallis,
where numerous problems of quadrature are dealt with, the
curves being now represented in Cartesian co-ordinates, and
algebra playing an important part. In a very curious manner,
by viewing the circle y = (1 - x²)<span class="sp">½</span> as a member of the series of
curves y = (1 - x²)¹, y = (1 - x²)², &amp;c., he was led to the proposition
that four times the reciprocal of the ratio of the circumference
to the diameter, <i>i.e.</i> <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">&pi;</span>;, is equal to the infinite product</p>

<p class="noind">The work of Wallis had evidently an important influence
on the next notable personality in the history of the subject,
James Gregory, who lived during the period when the higher
algebraic analysis was coming into power, and whose genius
helped materially to develop it. He had, however, in a certain
sense one eye fixed on the past and the other towards the
future. His first contribution<a name="FnAnchor_19b" id="FnAnchor_19b" href="#Footnote_19b"><span class="sp">19</span></a> was a variation of the method
of Archimedes. The latter, as we know, calculated the perimeters
of successive polygons, passing from one polygon to another of
double the number of sides; in a similar manner Gregory
calculated the areas. The general theorems which enabled him
to do this, after a start had been made, are</p>

<p class="noind">where A<span class="su">n</span>, A&prime;<span class="su">n</span> are the areas of the inscribed and the circumscribed
regular n-gons respectively. He also gave approximate
rectifications of circular arcs after the manner of Huygens;
and, what is very notable, he made an ingenious and, according
to J.E. Montucla, successful attempt to show that quadrature
of the circle by a Euclidean construction was impossible.<a name="FnAnchor_20b" id="FnAnchor_20b" href="#Footnote_20b"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Besides
all this, however, and far beyond it in importance, was his use
of infinite series. This merit he shares with his contemporaries
N. Mercator, Sir I. Newton and G.W. Leibnitz, and the exact
dates of discovery are a little uncertain. As far as the circle-squaring
functions are concerned, it would seem that Gregory
was the first (in 1670) to make known the series for the arc in
terms of the tangent, the series for the tangent in terms of the
arc, and the secant in terms of the arc; and in 1669 Newton
showed to Isaac Barrow a little treatise in manuscript containing
the series for the arc in terms of the sine, for the sine in terms of
the arc, and for the cosine in terms of the arc. These discoveries
formed an epoch in the history of mathematics generally, and
had, of course, a marked influence on after investigations
regarding circle-quadrature. Even among the mere computers

<p>A much less wise class than the &pi;-computers of modern times
are the pseudo-circle-squarers, or circle-squarers technically so
called, that is to say, persons who, having obtained by illegitimate
means a Euclidean construction for the quadrature or a
finitely expressible value for &pi;, insist on using faulty reasoning
and defective mathematics to establish their assertions. Such
persons have flourished at all times in the history of mathematics;
but the interest attaching to them is more psychological than
mathematical.<a name="FnAnchor_30b" id="FnAnchor_30b" href="#Footnote_30b"><span class="sp">30</span></a></p>

<p>It is of recent years that the most important advances in the
theory of circle-quadrature have been made. In 1873 Charles
Hermite proved that the base &eta; of the Napierian logarithms
cannot be a root of a rational algebraical equation of any degree.<a name="FnAnchor_31b" id="FnAnchor_31b" href="#Footnote_31b"><span class="sp">31</span></a>
To prove the same proposition regarding &pi; is to prove that a
Euclidean construction for circle-quadrature is impossible.
For in such a construction every point of the figure is obtained
by the intersection of two straight lines, a straight line and a
circle, or two circles; and as this implies that, when a unit of
length is introduced, numbers employed, and the problem
transformed into one of algebraic geometry, the equations to
be solved can only be of the first or second degree, it follows that
the equation to which we must be finally led is a rational equation
of even degree. Hermite<a name="FnAnchor_32b" id="FnAnchor_32b" href="#Footnote_32b"><span class="sp">32</span></a> did not succeed in his attempt on &pi;;
but in 1882 F. Lindemann, following exactly in Hermite&rsquo;s steps,
accomplished the desired result.<a name="FnAnchor_33b" id="FnAnchor_33b" href="#Footnote_33b"><span class="sp">33</span></a> (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trigonometry</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRCLEVILLE<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Pickaway
county, Ohio, U.S.A., about 26 m. S. by E. of Columbus, on the
Scioto river and the Ohio Canal. Pop. (1890) 6556; (1900)
6991 (551 negroes); (1910) 6744. It is served by the Cincinnati
&amp; Muskingum Valley (Pennsylvania lines) and the Norfolk &amp;
Western railways, and by the Scioto Valley electric line. Circleville
is situated in a farming region, and its leading industries
are the manufacture of straw boards and agricultural implements,
and the canning of sweet corn and other produce. The
city occupies the site of prehistoric earth-works, from one of
which, built in the form of a circle, it derived
its name. Circleville, first settled about 1806,
was chosen as the county-seat in 1810. The
court-house was built in the form of an octagon
at the centre of the circle, and circular streets
were laid out around it; but this arrangement
proved to be inconvenient, the court-house was
destroyed by fire in 1841, and at present no
trace of the ancient landmarks remains. Circleville
was incorporated as a village in 1814, and
was chartered as a city in 1853.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIRCUIT<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (Lat. <i>circuitus</i>, from <i>circum</i>, round,
and <i>ire</i>, to go), the act of moving round; so
circumference, or anything encircling or encircled.
The word is particularly known as a law term,
signifying the periodical progress of a legal tribunal for
the purpose of carrying out the administration of the law in the
several provinces of a country. It has long been applied to the
journey or progress which the judges have been in the habit of
making through the several counties of England, to hold courts
and administer justice, where recourse could not be had to the
king&rsquo;s court at Westminster (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Assize</a></span>).</p>

<p>In England, by sec. 23 of the Judicature Act 1875, power was
conferred on the crown, by order in council, to make regulations
respecting circuits, including the discontinuance of any circuit,
and the formation of any new circuit, and the appointment of
the place at which assizes are to be held on any circuit. Under
this power an order of council, dated the 5th of February 1876,
was made, whereby the circuit system was remodelled. A new
circuit, called the North-Eastern circuit, was created, consisting
of Newcastle and Durham taken out of the old Northern circuit,
and York and Leeds taken out of the Midland circuit. Oakham,
Leicester and Northampton, which had belonged to the Norfolk
circuit, were added to the Midland. The Norfolk circuit and the
Home circuit were abolished and a new South-Eastern circuit
was created, consisting of Huntingdon, Cambridge, Ipswich,
Norwich, Chelmsford, Hertford and Lewes, taken partly out
of the old Norfolk circuit and partly out of the Home circuit.
The counties of Kent and Surrey were left out of the circuit
system, the assizes for these counties being held by the judges
remaining in London. Subsequently Maidstone and Guildford
were united under the revived name of the Home circuit for the
purpose of the summer and winter assizes, and the assizes in
these towns were held by one of the judges of the Western circuit,
who, after disposing of the business there, rejoined his colleague
in Exeter. In 1899 this arrangement was abolished, and Maidstone
and Guildford were added to the South-Eastern circuit.
Other minor changes in the assize towns were made, which it is
unnecessary to particularize. Birmingham first became a
circuit town in the year 1884, and the work there became,
by arrangement, the joint property of the Midland and Oxford
circuits. There are alternative assize towns in the following
counties, viz.:&mdash;On the Western circuit, Salisbury and Devizes
for Wiltshire, and Wells and Taunton for Somerset; on the
South-Eastern, Ipswich and Bury St Edmunds for Suffolk;
on the North Wales circuit, Welshpool and Newtown for Montgomery;
and on the South Wales circuit, Cardiff and Swansea for Glamorgan.</p>

<p>According to the arrangements in force in 1909 there are
four assizes in each year. There are two principal assizes, viz.
the winter assizes, beginning in January, and the summer assizes,
beginning at the end of May. At these two assizes criminal and
civil business is disposed of in all the circuits. There are two
other assizes, viz. the autumn assizes and the Easter assizes.
The autumn assizes are regulated by acts of 1876 and 1877
(Winter Assizes Acts 1876 and 1877), and orders of council made
under the former act. They are held for the whole of England
and Wales, but for the purpose of these assizes the work is to a
large extent &ldquo;grouped,&rdquo; so that not every county has a separate
assize. For example, on the South-Eastern circuit Huntingdon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
is grouped with Cambridge; on the Midland, Rutland is grouped
with Lincoln; on the Northern, Westmorland is grouped with
Cumberland; and the North Wales and South Wales circuits
are united, and no assizes are held at some of the smaller towns.
At these assizes criminal business only is taken, except at
Manchester, Liverpool, Swansea, Birmingham and Leeds.
The Easter assizes are held in April and May on two circuits
only, viz. at Manchester and Liverpool on the Northern and at
Leeds on the North-Eastern. Both civil and criminal business
is taken at Manchester and Liverpool, but criminal business
only at Leeds.</p>

<p>Other changes were made, with a view to preventing the
complete interruption of the London sittings in the common law
division by the absence of the judges on circuit. The assizes
were so arranged as to commence on different dates in the various
circuits. For example, the summer assizes begin in the
South-Eastern and Western circuits on the 29th of May; in the
Northern circuit on the 28th of June; in the Midland and
Oxford circuits on the 16th of June; in the North-Eastern
circuit on the 6th of July; in the North Wales circuit on the
7th of July; and in the South Wales circuit on the 11th of July.
Again, there has been a continuous development of what may
be called the single-judge system. In the early days of the new
order the members of the court of appeal and the judges of the
chancery division shared the circuit work with the judges in the
common law division. This did not prove to be a satisfactory
arrangement. The assize work was not familiar and was
uncongenial to the chancery judges, who had but little training
or experience to fit them for it. Arrears increased in chancery,
and the appeal court was shorn of much of its strength for a
considerable part of the year. The practice was discontinued
in or about the year 1884. The appeal and chancery judges were
relieved of the duty of going on circuit, and an arrangement
was made by the treasury for making an allowance for expenses
of circuit to the common law judges, on whom the whole work
of the assizes was thrown. In order to cope with the assize
work, and at the same time keep the common law sittings going
in London, an experiment, which had been previously tried
by Lord Cairns and Lord Cross (then home secretary) and
discontinued, was revived. Instead of two judges going together
to each assize town, it was arranged that one judge should go
by himself to certain selected places&mdash;practically, it may be
said, to all except the more important provincial centres. The
only places to which two judges now go are Exeter, Winchester,
Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Stafford, Birmingham,
Newcastle, Durham, York, Leeds, Chester, and Cardiff or Swansea.</p>

<p>It could scarcely be said that, even with the amendments
introduced under orders in council, the circuit system was
altogether satisfactory or that the last word had been pronounced
on the subject. In the first report of the Judicature Commission,
dated March 25th, 1869, p. 17 (<i>Parl. Papers</i>, 1868-1869), the
majority report that &ldquo;the necessity for holding assizes in every
county without regard to the extent of the business to be transacted
in such county leads, in our judgment, to a great waste of
judicial strength and a great loss of time in going from one
circuit town to another, and causes much unnecessary cost and
inconvenience to those whose attendance is necessary or customary
at the assizes.&rdquo; And in their second report, dated July 3rd,
1872 (<i>Parl. Papers</i>, 1872, vol. xx.), they dwell upon the
advisability of grouping or a discontinuance of holding assizes &ldquo;in
several counties, for example, Rutland and Westmorland, where
it is manifestly an idle waste of time and money to have assizes.&rdquo;
It is thought that the grouping of counties which has been effected
for the autumn assizes might be carried still further and applied
to all the assizes; and that the system of holding the assizes
alternately in one of two towns within a county might be extended
to two towns in adjoining counties, for example, Gloucester
and Worcester. The facility of railway communication renders
this reform comparatively easy, and reforms in this direction
have been approved by the judges, but ancient custom and
local patriotism, interests, or susceptibility bar the way. The
Assizes and Quarter Sessions Act 1908 contributed something
to reform by dispensing with the obligation to hold assizes
at a fixed date if there is no business to be transacted. Nor
can it be said that the single-judge system has been altogether
a success. When there is only one judge for both civil and
criminal work, he properly takes the criminal business first.
He can fix only approximately the time when he can hope to
be free for the civil business. If the calendar is exceptionally
heavy or one or more of the criminal cases prove to be unexpectedly
long (as may easily happen), the civil business necessarily
gets squeezed into the short residue of the allotted time. Suitors
and their solicitors and witnesses are kept waiting for days, and
after all perhaps it proves to be impossible for the judge to take
the case, and a &ldquo;remanet&rdquo; is the result. It is the opinion of
persons of experience that the result has undoubtedly been to
drive to London much of the civil business which properly
belongs to the provinces, and ought to be tried there, and thus
at once to increase the burden on the judges and jurymen in
London, and to increase the costs of the trial of the actions sent
there. Some persons advocate the continuous sittings of the
high court in certain centres, such as Manchester, Liverpool,
Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham and Bristol, or (in fact) a
decentralization of the judicial system. There is already an
excellent court for chancery cases for Lancashire in the county
palatine court, presided over by the vice-chancellor, and with a
local bar which has produced many men of great ability and
even eminence. The Durham chancery court is also capable
of development. Another suggestion has been made for continuous
circuits throughout the legal year, so that a certain
number of the judges, according to a rota, should be continuously
in the provinces while the remaining judges did the London
business. The value of this suggestion would depend on an
estimate of the number of cases which might thus be tried in the
country in relief of the London list. This estimate it would be
difficult to make. The opinion has also been expressed that it
is essential in any changes that may be made to retain the
occasional administration by judges of the high court of criminal
jurisdiction, both in populous centres and in remote places. It
promotes a belief in the importance and dignity of justice and
the care to be given to all matters affecting a citizen&rsquo;s life,
liberty or character. It also does something, by the example
set by judges in country districts, to check any tendency to
undue severity of sentences in offences against property.</p>

<p>Counsel are not expected to practise on a circuit other than
that to which they have attached themselves, unless they receive
a special retainer. They are then said to &ldquo;go special,&rdquo; and the
fee in such a case is one hundred guineas for a king&rsquo;s counsel,
and fifty guineas for a junior. It is customary to employ one
member of the circuit on the side on which the counsel comes
special. Certain rules have been drawn up by the Bar Committee
for regulating the practice as to retainers on circuit.
(1) A special retainer must be given for a particular assize (a
circuit retainer will not, however, make it compulsory upon
counsel retained to go the circuit, but will give the right to
counsel&rsquo;s services should he attend the assize and the case be
entered for trial); (2) if the venue is changed to another place
on the same circuit, a fresh retainer is not required; (3) if the
action is not tried at the assize for which the retainer is given,
the retainer must be renewed for every subsequent assize until
the action is disposed of, unless a brief has been delivered;
(4) a retainer may be given for a future assize, without a retainer
for an intervening assize, unless notice of trial is given for such
intervening assize. There are also various regulations enforced
by the discipline of the circuit bar mess.</p>

<p>In the United States the English circuit system still exists
in some states, as in Massachusetts, where the judges sit in
succession in the various counties of the state. The term <i>circuit
courts</i> applies distinctively in America to a certain class of
inferior federal courts of the United States, exercising jurisdiction,
concurrently with the state courts, in certain matters
where the United States is a party to the litigation, or in cases
of crime against the United States. The circuit courts act in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
nine judicial circuits, divided as follows: <i>1st circuit</i>, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island; <i>2nd circuit</i>,
Connecticut, New York, Vermont; <i>3rd circuit</i>, Delaware, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania; <i>4th circuit</i>, Maryland, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia; <i>5th circuit</i>, Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas; <i>6th circuit</i>,
Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee; <i>7th circuit</i>, Illinois,
Indiana, Wisconsin; <i>8th circuit</i>, Arkansas, Colorado, Oklahoma,
Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; <i>9th
circuit</i>, Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii. A circuit court of appeals
is made up of three judges of the circuit court, the
judges of the district courts of the circuit, and the judge of the
Supreme Court allotted to the circuit.</p>

<p>In Scotland the judges of the supreme criminal court, or high
court of justiciary, form also three separate circuit courts,
consisting of two judges each; and the country, with the exception
of the Lothians, is divided into corresponding districts,
called the Northern, Western and Southern circuits. On the
Northern circuit, courts are held at Inverness, Perth, Dundee
and Aberdeen; on the Western, at Glasgow, Stirling and
Inveraray; and on the Southern, at Dumfries, Jedburgh and Ayr.</p>

<p>Ireland is divided into the North-East and the North-West
circuits, and those of Leinster, Connaught and Munster.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRCULAR NOTE<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span>, a documentary request by a bank to its
foreign correspondents to pay a specified sum of money to a

issued is furnished with a letter (containing the signature of an
official of the bank and the person named) called a letter of
indication, which is usually referred to in the circular note,

amount of the notes, but the notes need not necessarily be
cashed, but may be returned to the banker in exchange for the

the very fact which one seeks to demonstrate is used as a premise,
<i>i.e.</i> as part of the evidence on which the conclusion is based.
This argument is one form of the fallacy known as <i>petitio

lengthy arguments, the complicated character of which enables

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIRCUMCISION<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (Lat. <i>circum</i>, round, and <i>caedere</i>, to cut),
the cutting off of the foreskin. This surgical operation, which is
commonly prescribed for purely medical reasons, is also an
initiation or religious ceremony among Jews and Mahommedans,
and is a widespread institution in many Semitic races. It
remains, with Jews, a necessary preliminary to the admission of
proselytes, except in some Reformed communities. The origin
of the rite among the Jews is in Genesis (xvii.) placed in the age
of Abraham, and at all events it must have been very ancient,
for flint stones were used in the operation (Exodus iv. 25;
Joshua v. 2). The narrative in Joshua implies that the custom
was introduced by him, not that it had merely been in abeyance
in the Wilderness. At Gilgal he &ldquo;rolled away the reproach of
the Egyptians&rdquo; by circumcising the people. This obviously
means that whereas the Egyptians practised circumcision the
Jews in the land of the Pharaohs did not, and hence were regarded
with contempt. It was an old theory (Herodotus ii. 36) that
circumcision originated in Egypt; at all events it was practised
in that country in ancient times (Ebers, <i>Egypten und die Bücher
Mosis</i>, i. 278-284), and the same is true at the present day.
But it is not generally thought probable that the Hebrews
derived the rite directly from the Egyptians. As Driver puts it
(<i>Genesis</i>, p. 190): &ldquo;It is possible that, as Dillmann and Nowack
suppose, the peoples of N. Africa and Asia who practised the rite
adopted it from the Egyptians, but it appears in so many parts
of the world that it must at any rate in these cases have originated
independently.&rdquo; In another biblical narrative (Exodus iv. 25)
Moses is subject to the divine anger because he had not made
himself &ldquo;a bridegroom of blood,&rdquo; that is, had not been circumcised
before his marriage.</p>

<p>The rite of circumcision was practised by all the inhabitants
of Palestine with the exception of the Philistines. It was an
ancient custom among the Arabs, being presupposed in the
Koran. The only important Semitic peoples who most probably
did not follow the rite were the Babylonians and Assyrians
(Sayce, <i>Babyl. and Assyrians</i>, p. 47). Modern investigations have
brought to light many instances of the prevalence of circumcision
in various parts of the world. These facts are collected by Andrée
and Ploss, and go to prove that the rite is not only spread through
the Mahommedan world (Turks, Persians, Arabs, &amp;c.), but also is
practised by the Christian Abyssinians and the Copts, as well
as in central Australia and in America. In central Australia
(Spencer and Gillen, pp. 212-386) circumcision with a stone knife
must be undergone by every youth before he is reckoned a full
member of the tribe or is permitted to enter on the married state.
In other parts, too (<i>e.g.</i> Loango), no uncircumcised man may
marry. Circumcision was known to the Aztecs (Bancroft,
<i>Native Races</i>, vol. iii.), and is still practised by the Caribs of
the Orinoco and the Tacunas of the Amazon. The method and
period of the operation vary in important particulars. Among
the Jews it is performed in infancy, when the male child is eight
days old. The child is named at the same time, and the ceremony
is elaborate. The child is carried in to the godfather (<i>sandek</i>,
a hebraized form of the Gr. <span class="grk" title="sunteknos">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;godfather,&rdquo; post-class.),
who places the child on a cushion, which he holds on his knees
throughout the ceremony. The operator (<i>mohel</i>) uses a steel
knife, and pronounces various benedictions before and after the
rite is performed (see S. Singer, <i>Authorized Daily Prayer Book</i>,
pp. 304-307; an excellent account of the domestic festivities
and spiritual joys associated with the ceremony among medieval
and modern Jews may be read in S. Schechter&rsquo;s <i>Studies in
Judaism</i>, first series, pp. 351 seq.). Some tribes in South America
and elsewhere are said to perform the rite on the eighth day,
like the Jews. The Mazequas do it between the first and second
months. Among the Bedouins the rite is performed on children
of three years, amid dances and the selection of brides (Doughty,
<i>Arabia Deserta</i>, i. 340); among the Somalis the age is seven
(Reinisch, <i>Somalisprache</i>, p. 110). But for the most part the
tribes who perform the rite carry it out at the age of puberty.
Many facts bearing on this point are given by B. Stade in <i>Zeitschrift
für die alttest. Wissenschaft</i>, vi. (1886) pp. 132 seq.</p>

<p>The significance of the rite of circumcision has been much
disputed. Some see in it a tribal badge. If this be the true
origin of circumcision, it must go back to the time when men
went about naked. Mutilations (tattooing, removal of teeth
and so forth) were tribal marks, being partly sacrifices and
partly means of recognition (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mutilation</a></span>). Such initiatory
rites were often frightful ordeals, in which the neophyte&rsquo;s
courage was severely tested (Robertson Smith, <i>Religion of the
Semites</i>, p. 310). Some regard circumcision as a substitute for
far more serious rites, including even human sacrifice. Utilitarian
explanations have also been suggested. Sir R. Burton (<i>Memoirs
Anthrop. Soc.</i> i. 318) held that it was introduced to promote
fertility, and the claims of cleanliness have been put forward
(following Philo&rsquo;s example, see ed. Mangey, ii. 210). Most
probably, however, circumcision (which in many tribes is performed
on both sexes) was connected with marriage, and was a
preparation for connubium. It was in Robertson Smith&rsquo;s words
&ldquo;originally a preliminary to marriage, and so a ceremony of
introduction to the full prerogative of manhood,&rdquo; the transference
to infancy among the Jews being a later change. On
this view, the decisive Biblical reference would be the Exodus
passage (iv. 25), in which Moses is represented as being in danger
of his life because he had neglected the proper preliminary to
marriage. In Genesis, on the other hand, circumcision is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
external sign of God&rsquo;s covenant with Israel, and later Judaism
now regards it in this symbolical sense. Barton (<i>Semitic Origins</i>,
p. 100) declares that &ldquo;the circumstances under which it is performed
in Arabia point to the origin of circumcision as a sacrifice
to the goddess of fertility, by which the child was placed under
her protection and its reproductive powers consecrated to her
service.&rdquo; But Barton admits that initiation to the connubium
was the primitive origin of the rite.</p>

<p>As regards the non-ritual use of male circumcision, it may be
added that in recent years the medical profession has been
responsible for its considerable extension among other than
Jewish children, the operation being recommended not merely
in cases of malformation, but generally for reasons of health.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRCUS<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (Lat. <i>circus</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="kirkos">&#954;&#943;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span> or <span class="grk" title="krikos">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, a ring or circle;
probably &ldquo;circus&rdquo; and &ldquo;ring&rdquo; are of the same origin), a space,
in the strict sense circular, but sometimes oval or even oblong,
intended for the exhibition of races and athletic contests generally.
The circus differs from the theatre inasmuch as the
performance takes place in a central circular space, not on a stage
at one end of the building.</p>

<p>1. <i>In Roman antiquities</i> the circus was a building for the
exhibition of horse and chariot races and other amusements.
It consisted of tiers of seats running parallel with the sides of
the course, and forming a crescent round one of the ends. The
other end was straight and at right angles to the course, so that
the plan of the whole had nearly the form of an ellipse cut in
half at its vertical axis. Along the transverse axis ran a fence
(<i>spina</i>) separating the return course from the starting one. The
straight end had no seats, but was occupied by the stalls (<i>carceres</i>)
where the chariots and horses were held in readiness. This end
constituted also the front of the building with the main entrance.
At each end of the course were three conical pillars (<i>metae</i>) to
mark its limits.</p>

<p>The oldest building of this kind in Rome was the <i>Circus
Maximus</i>, in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine
hills, where, before the erection of any permanent structure,
races appear to have been held beside the altar of the god
Consus. The first building is assigned to Tarquin the younger,
but for a long time little seems to have been done to complete
its accommodation, since it is not till 329 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> that we hear
of stalls being erected for the chariots and horses. It was not
in fact till under the empire that the circus became a conspicuous
public resort. Caesar enlarged it to some extent, and also made
a canal 10 ft. broad between the lowest tier of seats (<i>podium</i>)
and the course as a precaution for the spectators&rsquo; safety when
exhibitions of fighting with wild beasts, such as were afterwards
confined to the amphitheatre, took place. When these exhibitions
were removed, and the canal (<i>euripus</i>) was no longer
necessary, Nero had it filled up. Augustus is said to have placed
an obelisk on the <i>spina</i> between the <i>metae</i>, and to have built a
new <i>pulvinar</i>, or imperial box; but if this is taken in connexion
with the fact that the circus had been partially destroyed by
fire in 31 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, it may be supposed that besides this he had
restored it altogether. Only the lower tiers of seats were of
stone, the others being of wood, and this, from the liability to
fire, may account for the frequent restorations to which the circus
was subject; it would also explain the falling of the seats by
which a crowd of people were killed in the time of Antoninus
Pius. In the reign of Claudius, apparently after a fire, the
<i>carceres</i> of stone (tufa) were replaced by marble, and the <i>metae</i>
of wood by gilt bronze. Under Domitian, again, after a fire, the
circus was rebuilt and the carceres increased to 12 instead
of 8 as before. The work was finished by Trajan. See further
for seating capacity, &amp;c., <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>Archaeology</i>, § &ldquo;Places of
Amusement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and
women were not separated. The lower seats were reserved for
persons of rank; there were also various state boxes, <i>e.g.</i> for
the giver of the games and his friends (called <i>cubicula</i> or <i>suggestus</i>).
The principal object of attraction apart from the racing must
have been the <i>spina</i> or low wall which ran down the middle
of the course, with its obelisks, images and ornamental shrines.
On it also were seven figures of dolphins and seven oval objects,
one of which was taken down at every round made in a race,
so that spectators might see readily how the contest proceeded.
The chariot race consisted of seven rounds of the course. The
chariots started abreast, but in an oblique line, so that the outer
chariot might be compensated for the wider circle it had to make
at the other end. Such a race was called a <i>missus</i>, and as many
as 24 of these would take place in a day. The competitors
wore different colours, originally white and red (<i>albata</i> and
<i>russata</i>), to which green (<i>prasina</i>) and blue (<i>veneta</i>) were added.
Domitian introduced two more colours, gold and purple (<i>purpureus
et auratus pannus</i>), which probably fell into disuse after
his death. To provide the horses and large staff of attendants
it was necessary to apply to rich capitalists and owners of studs,
and from this there grew up in time four select companies
(<i>factiones</i>) of circus purveyors, which were identified with the
four colours, and with which those who organized the races had
to contract for the proper supply of horses and men. The drivers
(<i>aurigae, agitatores</i>), who were mostly slaves, were sometimes
held in high repute for their skill, although their calling was
regarded with contempt. The horses most valued were those of
Sicily, Spain and Cappadocia, and great care was taken in training
them. Chariots with two horses (<i>bigae</i>) or four (<i>quadrigae</i>)
were most common, but sometimes also they had three (<i>trigae</i>),
and exceptionally more than four horses. Occasionally there
was combined with the chariots a race of riders (<i>desultores</i>),
each rider having two horses and leaping from one to the other
during the race. At certain of the races the proceedings were
opened by a <i>pompa</i> or procession in which images of the gods
and of the imperial family deified were conveyed in cars drawn
by horses, mules or elephants, attended by the colleges of priests,
and led by the presiding magistrate (in some cases by the
emperor himself) seated in a chariot in the dress and with the
insignia of a triumphator. The procession passed from the
capitol along the forum, and on to the circus, where it was received
by the people standing and clapping their hands. The
presiding magistrate gave the signal for the races by throwing
a white flag (<i>mappa</i>) on to the course.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the Circus Maximus in Rome was the
<i>Circus Flaminius</i>, erected 221 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, in the censorship of C.
Flaminius, from whom it may have taken its name; or the
name may have been derived from Prata Flaminia, where it
was situated, and where also were held plebeian meetings.
The only games that are positively known to have been celebrated
in this circus were the <i>Ludi Taurii</i> and <i>Plebeii</i>. There is no
mention of it after the 1st century. Its ruins were identified
in the 16th century at S. Catarina dei Funari and the Palazzo
Mattei.</p>

<p>A third circus in Rome was erected by Caligula in the gardens
of Agrippina, and was known as the <i>Circus Neronis</i>, from the
notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of
Nero. A fourth was constructed by Maxentius outside the
Porta Appia near the tomb of Caecilia Metella, where its ruins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
are still, and now afford the only instance from which an idea
of the ancient circi in Rome can be obtained. It was traced to
Caracalla, till the discovery of an inscription in 1825 showed
it to be the work of Maxentius. Old topographers speak of six
circi, but two of these appear to be imaginary, the Circus Florae
and the Circus Sallustii.</p>

<p>Circus races were held in connexion with the following public
festivals, and generally on the last day of the festival, if it
extended over more than one day:&mdash;(1) The <i>Consualia</i>,
August 21st, December 15th; (2) <i>Equirria</i>, February 27th,
March 14th; (3) <i>Ludi Romani</i>, September 4th-19th; (4) <i>Ludi
Plebeii</i>, November 4th-17th; (5) <i>Cerialia</i>, April 12th-19th;
(6) <i>Ludi Apollinares</i>, July 6th-13th; (7) <i>Ludi Megalenses</i>,

<p>2. <i>The Modern Circus.</i>&mdash;The &ldquo;circus&rdquo; in modern times is
a form of popular entertainment which has little in common
with the institution of classical Rome. It is frequently nomadic
in character, the place of the permanent building known to the
ancients as the circus being taken by a tent, which is carried
from place to place and set up temporarily on any site procurable
at country fairs or in provincial towns, and in which spectacular
performances are given by a troupe employed by the proprietor.
The centre of the tent forms an arena arranged as a horse-ring,
strewn with tan or other soft substance, where the performances
take place, the seats of the spectators being arranged in ascending
tiers around the central space as in the Roman circus. The
traditional type of exhibition in the modern travelling circus
consists of feats of horsemanship, such as leaping through hoops
from the back of a galloping horse, standing with one foot on
each of two horses galloping side by side, turning somersaults
from a springboard over a number of horses standing close
together, or accomplishing acrobatic tricks on horseback. These
performances, by male and female riders, are varied by the
introduction of horses trained to perform tricks, and by drolleries
on the part of the clown, whose place in the circus is as firmly
established by tradition as in the pantomime.</p>

<p>The popularity of the circus in England may be traced to that
kept by Philip Astley (d. 1814) in London at the end of the 18th
century. Astley was followed by Ducrow, whose feats of horsemanship
had much to do with establishing the traditions of the
circus, which were perpetuated by Hengler&rsquo;s and Sanger&rsquo;s
celebrated shows in a later generation. In America a circus-actor
named Ricketts is said to have performed before George Washington
in 1780, and in the first half of the 19th century the establishments
of Purdy, Welch &amp; Co., and of van Amburgh gave a
wide popularity to the circus in the United States. All former
circus-proprietors were, however, far surpassed in enterprise and
resource by P.T. Barnum (<i>q.v.</i>), whose claim to be the possessor
of &ldquo;the greatest show on earth&rdquo; was no exaggeration. The
influence of Barnum, however, brought about a considerable
change in the character of the modern circus. In arenas too
large for speech to be easily audible, the traditional comic dialogue
of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly,
while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated
to the background the old-fashioned equestrian feats, which
were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances, and
by exhibitions of skill, strength and daring, requiring the
employment of immense numbers of performers and often of
complicated and expensive machinery. These tendencies are,
as is natural, most marked in shows given in permanent buildings
in large cities, such as the London Hippodrome, which was built
as a combination of the circus, the menagerie and the variety
theatre, where wild animals such as lions and elephants from
time to time appeared in the ring, and where convulsions of
nature such as floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have
been produced with an extraordinary wealth of realistic display.
At the Hippodrome in Paris&mdash;unlike its London namesake, a
circus of the true classical type in which the arena is entirely
surrounded by the seats of the spectators&mdash;chariot races after
the Roman model were held in the latter part of the 19th
century, at which prizes of considerable value were given by the
management.</p>

<i>in situ</i>, except the amphitheatre and some indications of the walls.
To the west of the town is Cirencester House, the seat of Earl
Bathurst. The first Lord Bathurst (1684-1775) devoted himself
to beautifying the fine demesne of Oakley Park, which he
planted and adorned with remarkable artificial ruins. This
nobleman, who became baron in 1711 and earl in 1772, was a
patron of art and literature no less than a statesman; and Pope,
a frequent visitor here, was allowed to design the building known
as Pope&rsquo;s Seat, in the park, commanding a splendid prospect
of woods and avenues. Swift was another appreciative visitor.
The house contains portraits by Lawrence, Gainsborough,
Romney, Lely, Reynolds, Hoppner, Kneller and many others.
A mile west of the town is the Royal Agricultural College,
incorporated by charter in 1845. Its buildings include a chapel,
a dining hall, a library, a lecture theatre, laboratories, classrooms,
private studies and dormitories for the students, apartments
for resident professors, and servants&rsquo; offices; also a
museum containing a collection of anatomical and pathological
preparations, and mineralogical, botanical and geological specimens.
The college farm comprises 500 acres, 450 of which
are arable; and on it are the well-appointed farm-buildings
and the veterinary hospital. Besides agriculture, the course of
instruction at the college includes chemistry, natural and
mechanical philosophy, natural history, mensuration, surveying
and drawing, and other subjects of practical importance to the
farmer, proficiency in which is tested by means of sessional
examinations. The industries of Cirencester comprise various
branches of agriculture. It has connexion by a branch canal
with the Thames and Severn canal.</p>

<p>Corinium was a flourishing Romano-British town, at first
perhaps a cavalry post, but afterwards, for the greater part of
the Roman period, purely a civilian city. At Chedworth, 7 m.
N.E., is one of the most noteworthy Roman villas in England.
Cirencester (<i>Cirneceaster</i>, <i>Cyrenceaster</i>, <i>Cyringceaster</i>) is described
in Domesday as ancient demesne of the crown. The manor was
granted by William I. to William Fitzosbern; on reverting to
the crown it was given in 1189, with the township, to the Augustinian
abbey founded here by Henry I. The struggle of the
townsmen to prove that Cirencester was a borough probably
began in the same year, when they were amerced for a false
presentment. Four inquisitions during the 13th century supported
the abbot&rsquo;s claims, yet in 1343 the townsmen declared
in a chancery bill of complaint that Cirencester was a borough
distinct from the manor, belonging to the king but usurped by
the abbot, who since 1308 had abated their court of provostry.
Accordingly they produced a copy of a forged charter from
Henry I. to the town; the court ignored this and the abbot
obtained a new charter and a writ of <i>supersedeas</i>. For their
success against the earls of Kent and Salisbury Henry IV. in
1403 gave the townsmen a gild merchant, although two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
inquisitions reiterated the abbot&rsquo;s rights. These were confirmed
in 1408-1409 and 1413; in 1418 the charter was annulled, and
in 1477 parliament declared that Cirencester was not corporate.
After several unsuccessful attempts to re-establish the gild
merchant, the government in 1592 was vested in the bailiff of the
lord of the manor. Cirencester became a parliamentary borough
in 1572, returning two members, but was deprived of representation
in 1885. Besides the &ldquo;new market&rdquo; of Domesday
Book the abbots obtained charters in 1215 and 1253 for fairs
during the octaves of All Saints and St Thomas the Martyr.
The wool trade gave these great importance; in 1341 there
were ten wool merchants in Cirencester, and Leland speaks of
the abbots&rsquo; cloth-mill, while Camden calls it the greatest market
for wool in England.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRILLO, DOMENICO<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1739-1799), Italian physician and
patriot, was born at Grumo in the kingdom of Naples. Appointed
while yet a young man to a botanical professorship, Cirillo went
some years afterwards to England, where he was elected fellow
of the Royal Society, and to France. On his return to Naples
he was appointed successively to the chairs of practical and
theoretical medicine. He wrote voluminously and well on
scientific subjects and secured an extensive medical practice.
On the French occupation of Naples and the proclamation of
the Parthenopean republic (1799), Cirillo, after at first refusing
to take part in the new government, consented to be chosen a
representative of the people and became a member of the
legislative commission, of which he was eventually elected
president. On the abandonment of the republic by the French
(June 1799), Cardinal Ruffo and the army of King Ferdinand
IV. returned to Naples, and the Republicans withdrew, ill-armed
and inadequately provisioned, to the forts. After a short siege
they surrendered on honourable terms, life and liberty being
guaranteed them by the signatures of Ruffo, of Foote, and of
Micheroux. But the arrival of Nelson changed the complexion
of affairs, and he refused to ratify the capitulation. Secure
under the British flag, Ferdinand and his wife, Caroline of
Austria, showed themselves eager for revenge, and Cirillo was
involved with the other republicans in the vengeance of the
royal family. He asked Lady Hamilton (wife of the British
minister to Naples) to intercede on his behalf, but Nelson wrote
in reference to the petition: &ldquo;Domenico Cirillo, who had been
the king&rsquo;s physician, might have been saved, but that he chose
to play the fool and lie, denying that he had ever made any
speeches against the government, and saying that he only took
care of the poor in the hospitals&rdquo; (<i>Nelson and the Neapolitan
Jacobins</i>, Navy Records Society, 1903). He was condemned
and hanged on the 29th of October 1799. Cirillo, whose favourite
study was botany, and who was recognized as an entomologist
by Linnaeus, left many books, in Latin and Italian, all of them
treating of medical and scientific subjects, and all of little value
now. Exception must, however, be made in favour of the
<i>Virtù morali dell&rsquo; Asino</i>, a pleasant philosophical pamphlet
remarkable for its double charm of sense and style. He introduced
many medical innovations into Naples, particularly
inoculation for smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIRQUE<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (Lat. <i>circus</i>, ring), a French word used in physical
geography to denote a semicircular crater-like amphitheatre
at the head of a valley, or in the side of a glaciated mountain.
The valley cirque is characteristic of calcareous districts. In
the Chiltern Hills especially, and generally along the chalk
escarpments, a flat-bottomed valley with an intermittent
stream winds into the hill and ends suddenly in a cirque. There
is an excellent example at Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire, where
it appears as though an enormous flat-bottomed scoop had been
driven into the hillside and dragged outwards to the plain. In
all cases it is found that the valley floor consists of hard or
impervious rock above which lies a permeable or soluble stratum
of considerable thickness. In the case of the chalk hills the
upper strata are very porous, and the descending water with
atmospheric and humous acids in solution has great solvent
power. During the winter this upper layer becomes saturated
and some of the water drains away along joints in the escarpment.
An underground stream is thus developed carrying away a great
deal of material in solution, and in consequence the ground above
slowly collapses over the stream, while the cirque at the head,
where the stream issues, gradually works backward and may
pass completely through the hills, leaving a gap of which another
drainage system may take possession. In the limestone country
of the Cotteswold Hills, many small intermittent tributary
streams are headed by cirques, and some of the longer dry valleys
have springs issuing from beneath their lower ends, the dry
valleys being collapsed areas above underground streams not
yet revealed. In this case the pervious limestone is underlain
by beds of impervious clay. There are many of these in the
Jura Mountains. The Cirque de St Sulpice is a fine example
where the impervious bed is a marly clay.</p>

<p>The origin of the glacial cirque is entirely different and is
said by W.D. Johnson (<i>Journal of Geology</i>, xii. No. 7, 1904) to
be due to basal sapping and erosion under the <i>bergschrund</i> of
the glacier. In this he is supported by G.K. Gilbert in the same
journal, who produces some remarkable examples from the
Sierra Nevada in California, where the mountain fragments
have been left behind &ldquo;like a sheet of dough upon a board after
the biscuit tin has done its work&rdquo;; so that above the head
of the glaciers &ldquo;the rock detail is rugged and splintered but its
general effect is that of a great symmetrical arc.&rdquo; Descending
one of the bergschrunds of Mt. Lyell to a depth of 150 ft.,
Johnson found a rock floor cumbered with ice and blocks of
rock and the rock face a literally vertical cliff &ldquo;much riven, its
fracture planes outlining sharp angular masses in all stages of
displacement and dislodgment.&rdquo; Judging from these facts,
he interprets the deep valleys with cirques at their head in
formerly glaciated regions where at the head there is a &ldquo;reversed
grade&rdquo; of slope, as due to ice-erosion at valley-heads where
scour is impossible at the sides of the mountain but strongest
under the glacier head where the ice is deepest. The opponents
of ice-erosion nevertheless recognize the very frequent occurrence
of glacial cirques often containing small lakes such as that
under Cader Idris in Wales, or at the head of Little Timber
Creek, Montana, and numerous examples in Alpine districts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CISSEY, ERNEST LOUIS OCTAVE COURTOT DE<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1810-1882),
French general, was born at Paris on the 23rd of September
1810, and after passing through St Cyr, entered the army in
1832, becoming captain in 1839. He saw active service in Algeria,
and became <i>chef d&rsquo;escadron</i> in 1849 and lieutenant-colonel in
1850. He took part as a colonel in the Crimean War, and after
the battle of Inkerman received the rank of general of brigade.
In 1863 he was promoted general of division. When the Franco-German
War broke out in 1870, de Cissey was given a divisional
command in the Army of the Rhine, and he was included in
the surrender of Bazaine&rsquo;s army at Metz. He was released from
captivity only at the end of the war, and on his return was at
once appointed by the Versailles government to a command
in the army engaged in the suppression of the Commune, a task
in the execution of which he displayed great rigour. From July
1871 de Cissey sat as a deputy, and he had already become
minister of war. He occupied this post several times during the
critical period of the reorganization of the French army. In
1880, whilst holding the command of the XI. corps at Nantes,
he was accused of having relations with a certain Baroness
Kaula, who was said to be a spy in the pay of Germany, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
he was in consequence relieved from duty. An inquiry subsequently
held resulted in de Cissey&rsquo;s favour (1881). He died on
the 15th of June 1882 at Paris.</p>

between two given lines, and in order to solve the problem of
duplicating the cube. It was further investigated by John Wallis,
Christiaan Huygens (who determined the length of any arc in
1657), and Pierre de Fermat (who evaluated the area between
the curve and its asymptote in 1661). It is constructed in the
following manner. Let APB be a semicircle, BT the tangent

a point Q on AT so that AQ always equals
PT; then the locus of Q is the cissoid.
Sir Isaac Newton devised the following
mechanical construction. Take a rod LMN
bent at right angles at M, such that
MN = AB; let the leg LM always pass
through a fixed point O on AB produced
such that OA = CA, where C is the middle
point of AB, and cause N to travel along
the line perpendicular to AB at C; then
the midpoint of MN traces the cissoid.
The curve is symmetrical about the axis
of x, and consists of two infinite branches
asymptotic to the line BT and forming a
cusp at the origin. The cartesian equation,
when A is the origin and AB = 2a, is
y²(2a - x) = x³; the polar equation is r = 2a sin &theta; tan &theta;. The
cissoid is the first positive pedal of the parabola y² + 8ax = 0
for the vertex, and the inverse of the parabola y² = 8ax, the
vertex being the centre of inversion, and the semi-latus rectum
the constant of inversion. The area between the curve and its
asymptote is 3&pi;a², <i>i.e.</i> three times the area of the generating
circle.</p>

<p>The term cissoid has been given in modern times to curves
generated in similar manner from other figures than the circle,
and the form described above is distinguished as the cissoid of
Diocles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIS-SUTLEJ STATES<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span>, the southern portion of the Punjab,
India. The name, now obsolete, came into use in 1809, when the
Sikh chiefs south of the Sutlej passed under British protection,
and was generally applied to the country south of the Sutlej
and north of the Delhi territory, bounded on the E. by the
Himalayas, and on the W. by Sirsa district. Before 1846 the
greater part of this territory was independent, the chiefs being
subject merely to control from a political officer stationed at
Umballa, and styled the agent of the governor-general for the
Cis-Sutlej states. After the first Sikh War the full administration
of the territory became vested in this officer. In 1849 occurred
the annexation of the Punjab, when the Cis-Sutlej states commissionership,
comprising the districts of Umballa, Ferozepore,
Ludhiana, Thanesar and Simla, was incorporated with the new
province. The name continued to be applied to this division
until 1862, when, owing to Ferozepore having been transferred
to the Lahore, and a part of Thanesar to the Delhi division, it
ceased to be appropriate. Since then, the tract remaining has
been known as the Umballa division. Patiala, Jind and Nabha
were appointed a separate political agency in 1901. Excluding
Bahawalpur, for which there is no political agent, and Chamba,
the other states are grouped under the commissioners of Jullunder

colour of the habit, over which is worn a black scapular or apron).
In 1098 St Robert, born of a noble family in Champagne, at first
a Benedictine monk, and then abbot of certain hermits settled at
Molesme near Châtillon, being dissatisfied with the manner of
life and observance there, migrated with twenty of the monks
to a swampy place called Cîteaux in the diocese of Châlons, not
far from Dijon. Count Odo of Burgundy here built them a
monastery, and they began to live a life of strict observance
according to the letter of St Benedict&rsquo;s rule. In the following
year Robert was compelled by papal authority to return to
Molesme, and Alberic succeeded him as abbot of Cîteaux and
held the office till his death in 1109, when the Englishman St
Stephen Harding became abbot, until 1134. For some years
the new institute seemed little likely to prosper; few novices
came, and in the first years of Stephen&rsquo;s abbacy it seemed
doomed to failure. In 1112, however, St Bernard and thirty
others offered themselves to the monastery, and a rapid and
wonderful development at once set in. The next three years
witnessed the foundation of the four great &ldquo;daughter-houses of
Cîteaux&rdquo;&mdash;La Ferté, Pontigny, Clairvaux and Morimond.
At Stephen&rsquo;s death there were over 30 Cistercian houses; at
Bernard&rsquo;s (1154) over 280; and by the end of the century over
500; and the Cistercian influence in the Church more than kept
pace with this material expansion, so that St Bernard saw one of
his monks ascend the papal chair as Eugenius III.</p>

<p>The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance
of St Benedict&rsquo;s rule&mdash;how literal may be seen from the controversy
between St Bernard and Peter the Venerable, abbot of
Cluny (see Maitland, <i>Dark Ages</i>, § xxii.). The Cistercians rejected
alike all mitigations and all developments, and tried to reproduce
the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'lire'">life</span> exactly as it had been in St Benedict&rsquo;s time, indeed in
various points they went beyond it in austerity. The most
striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour,
and especially to field-work, which became a special characteristic
of Cistercian life. In order to make time for this work they cut
away the accretions to the divine office which had been steadily
growing during three centuries, and in Cluny and the other
Black Monk monasteries had come to exceed greatly in length
the regular canonical office: one only of these accretions did
they retain, the daily recitation of the Office of the Dead (Edm.
Bishop, <i>Origin of the Primer</i>, Early English Text Society, original
series, 109, p. xxx.).</p>

<p>It was as agriculturists and horse and cattle breeders that,
after the first blush of their success and before a century had
passed, the Cistercians exercised their chief influence on the
progress of civilization in the later middle ages: they were the
great farmers of those days, and many of the improvements in
the various farming operations were introduced and propagated
by them; it is from this point of view that the importance of
their extension in northern Europe is to be estimated. The
Cistercians at the beginning renounced all sources of income
arising from benefices, tithes, tolls and rents, and depended for
their income wholly on the land. This developed an organized
system for selling their farm produce, cattle and horses, and
notably contributed to the commercial progress of the countries
of western Europe. Thus by the middle of the 13th century the
export of wool by the English Cistercians had become a feature
in the commerce of the country. Farming operations on so
extensive a scale could not be carried out by the monks alone,
whose choir and religious duties took up a considerable portion
of their time; and so from the beginning the system of lay
brothers was introduced on a large scale. The lay brothers
were recruited from the peasantry and were simple uneducated
men, whose function consisted in carrying out the various field-works
and plying all sorts of useful trades; they formed a body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
of men who lived alongside of the choir monks, but separate
from them, not taking part in the canonical office, but having
their own fixed round of prayer and religious exercises. A lay
brother was never ordained, and never held any office of
superiority. It was by this system of lay brothers that the
Cistercians were able to play their distinctive part in the progress
of European civilization. But it often happened that the number
of lay brothers became excessive and out of proportion to the
resources of the monasteries, there being sometimes as many
as 200, or even 300, in a single abbey. On the other hand, at
any rate in some countries, the system of lay brothers in course
of time worked itself out; thus in England by the close of the
14th century it had shrunk to relatively small proportions, and
in the 15th century the régime of the English Cistercian houses
tended to approximate more and more to that of the Black
Monks.</p>

<p>The Cistercian polity calls for special mention. Its lines were
adumbrated by Alberic, but it received its final form at a meeting
of the abbots in the time of Stephen Harding, when was drawn
up the <i>Carta Caritatis</i> (Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat.</i> clxvi. 1377), a
document which arranged the relations between the various
houses of the Cistercian order, and exercised a great influence
also upon the future course of western monachism. From one
point of view, it may be regarded as a compromise between
the primitive Benedictine system, whereby each abbey was
autonomous and isolated, and the complete centralization of
Cluny, whereby the abbot of Cluny was the only true superior
in the body. Cîteaux, on the one hand, maintained the independent
organic life of the houses&mdash;each abbey had its own
abbot, elected by its own monks; its own community, belonging
to itself and not to the order in general; its own property
and finances administered by itself, without interference from
outside. On the other hand, all the abbeys were subjected to
the general chapter, which met yearly at Cîteaux, and consisted
of the abbots only; the abbot of Cîteaux was the president of
the chapter and of the order, and the visitor of each and every
house, with a predominant influence and the power of enforcing
everywhere exact conformity to Cîteaux in all details of the
exterior life&mdash;observance, chant, customs. The principle was
that Cîteaux should always be the model to which all the other
houses had to conform. In case of any divergence of view at
the chapter, the side taken by the abbot of Cîteaux was always
to prevail (see F.A. Gasquet, <i>Sketch of Monastic Constitutional
History</i>, pp. xxxv-xxxviii, prefixed to English trans, of Montalembert&rsquo;s
<i>Monks of the West</i>, ed. 1895).</p>

<p>By the end of the 12th century the Cistercian houses numbered
500; in the 13th a hundred more were added; and in the 15th,
when the order attained its greatest extension, there were close
on 750 houses: the larger figures sometimes given are now
recognized as apocryphal. Nearly half of the houses had been
founded, directly or indirectly, from Clairvaux, so great was
St Bernard&rsquo;s influence and prestige: indeed he has come almost
to be regarded as the founder of the Cistercians, who have often
been called Bernardines. The order was spread all over western
Europe,&mdash;chiefly in France, but also in Germany, England,
Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Italy and Sicily,
Spain and Portugal,&mdash;where some of the houses, as Alcobaça,
were of almost incredible magnificence. In England the first
foundation was Furness (1127), and many of the most beautiful
monastic buildings of the country, beautiful in themselves and
beautiful in their sites, were Cistercian,&mdash;as Tintern, Rievaulx,
Byland, Fountains. A hundred were established in England in
the next hundred years, and then only one more up to the
Dissolution (for list, see table and map in F.A. Gasquet&rsquo;s <i>English
Monastic Life</i>, or <i>Catholic Dictionary</i>, art. &ldquo;Cistercians&rdquo;).</p>

<p>For a hundred years, till the first quarter of the 13th century,
the Cistercians supplanted Cluny as the most powerful order
and the chief religious influence in western Europe. But then
in turn their influence began to wane, chiefly, no doubt, because
of the rise of the mendicant orders, who ministered more directly
to the needs and ideas of the new age. But some of the reasons
of Cistercian decline were internal. In the first place, there was
the permanent difficulty of maintaining in its first fervour a
body embracing hundreds of monasteries and thousands of
monks, spread all over Europe; and as the Cistercian very
<i>raison d&rsquo;être</i> consisted in its being a &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; a return to
primitive monachism, with its field-work and severe simplicity,
any failures to live up to the ideal proposed worked more
disastrously among Cistercians than among mere Benedictines,
who were intended to live a life of self-denial, but not of great
austerity. Relaxations were gradually introduced in regard to
diet and to simplicity of life, and also in regard to the sources
of income, rents and tolls being admitted and benefices incorporated,
as was done among the Benedictines; the farming
operations tended to produce a commercial spirit; wealth and
splendour invaded many of the monasteries, and the choir
monks abandoned field-work.</p>

<p>The later history of the Cistercians is largely one of attempted
revivals and reforms. The general chapter for long battled
bravely against the invasion of relaxations and abuses. In 1335
Benedict XII., himself a Cistercian, promulgated a series of
regulations to restore the primitive spirit of the order, and in
the 15th century various popes endeavoured to promote reforms.
All these efforts at a reform of the great body of the order proved
unavailing; but local reforms, producing various semi-independent
offshoots and congregations, were successfully carried
out in many parts in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries.
In the 17th another great effort at a general reform was made,
promoted by the pope and the king of France; the general
chapter elected Richelieu (commendatory) abbot of Cîteaux,
thinking he would protect them from the threatened reform.
In this they were disappointed, for he threw himself wholly on
the side of reform. So great, however, was the resistance, and
so serious the disturbances that ensued, that the attempt to
reform Cîteaux itself and the general body of the houses had
again to be abandoned, and only local projects of reform could
be carried out. In 1598 had arisen the reformed congregation
of the Feuillants, which spread widely in France and Italy, in
the latter country under the name of &ldquo;Improved Bernardines.&rdquo;
The French congregation of Sept-Fontaines (1654) also deserves
mention. In 1663 de Rancé reformed La Trappe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trappists</a></span>).</p>

<p>The Reformation, the ecclesiastical policy of Joseph II., the
French Revolution, and the revolutions of the 19th century,
almost wholly destroyed the Cistercians; but some survived,
and since the beginning of the last half of the 19th century
there has been a considerable recovery. They are at present
divided into three bodies: (1) the Common Observance, with
about 30 monasteries and 800 choir monks, the large majority
being in Austria-Hungary; they represent the main body of
the order and follow a mitigated rule of life; they do not carry
on field-work, but have large secondary schools, and are in
manner of life little different from fairly observant Benedictine
Black monks; of late years, however, signs are not wanting
of a tendency towards a return to older ideas; (2) the Middle
Observance, embracing some dozen monasteries and about 150
choir monks; (3) the Strict Observance, or Trappists (<i>q.v.</i>), with
nearly 60 monasteries, about 1600 choir monks and 2000 lay
brothers.</p>

<p>In all there are about 100 Cistercian monasteries and about
4700 monks, including lay brothers. There have always been a
large number of Cistercian nuns; the first nunnery was founded
at Tart in the diocese of Langres, 1125; at the period of their
widest extension there are said to have been 900 nunneries,
and the communities were very large. The nuns were devoted
to contemplation and also did field-work. In Spain and France
certain Cistercian abbesses had extraordinary privileges. Numerous
reforms took place among the nuns. The best known of
all Cistercian convents was probably Port-Royal (<i>q.v.</i>), reformed
by Angélique Arnaud, and associated with the story of the
Jansenist controversy. After all the troubles of the 19th century
there still exist 100 Cistercian nunneries with 3000 nuns, choir
and lay; of these, 15 nunneries with 900 nuns are Trappist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CITATION<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (Lat. <i>citare</i>, to cite), in law, a summons to appear,
more particularly applied in England to process in the probate
and divorce division of the high court. In the ecclesiastical
courts, citation was a method of commencing a probate suit,
answering to a writ of summons at common law, and it is now
in English probate practice an instrument issuing from the
principal probate registry, chiefly used when a person, having
the superior right to take a grant, delays or declines to do so,
and another having an inferior right desires to obtain a grant;
the party having the prior right is cited to appear and either to
renounce the grant or show cause why it should not be decreed
to the citator. In divorce practice, when a petitioner has filed his
petition and affidavit, he extracts a citation, <i>i.e.</i> a command
drawn in the name of the sovereign and signed by one of the
registrars of the court, calling upon the alleged offender to appear
and make answer to the petition. In Scots law, citation is used
in the sense of a writ of summons. The word in its more general
literary sense means the act of quoting, or the referring to an
authority in support of an argument.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CÎTEAUX<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span>, a village of eastern France, in the department of
Côte d&rsquo;Or, 16 m. S.S.E. of Dijon by road. It is celebrated
for the great abbey founded by Robert, abbot of Molesme,
in 1098, which became the headquarters of the Cistercian
order. The buildings which remain date chiefly from the 18th
century and are of little interest. The church, destroyed
in 1792, used to contain the tombs of the earlier dukes of

<p><span class="bold">CITHAERON<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span>, now called from its pine forests Elatea, a famous
mountain range (4626 ft.) in the south of Boeotia, separating
that state from Megaris and Attica. It was famous in Greek
mythology, and is frequently mentioned by the great poets,
especially by Sophocles. It was on Cithaeron that Aetaeon
was changed into a stag, that Pentheus was torn to pieces by
the Bacchantes whose orgies he had been watching, and that the
infant Oedipus was exposed. This mountain, too, was the scene
of the mystic rites of Dionysus, and the festival of the Daedala
in honour of Hera. The carriage-road from Athens to Thebes
crosses the range by a picturesque defile (the pass of Dryoscephalae,
&ldquo;Oak-heads&rdquo;), which was at one time guarded on the
Attic side by a strong fortress, the ruins of which are known as
Ghyphto-kastro (&ldquo;Gipsy Castle&rdquo;). Plataea is situated on the
north slope of the mountain, and the strategy of the battle of
479 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> was considerably affected by the fact that it was necessary
for the Greeks to keep their communications open by the passes
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plataea</a></span>). The best known of these is that of Dryoscephalae,
which must then, as now, have been the direct route
from Athens to Thebes. Two other passes, farther to the west,
were crossed by the roads from Plataea to Athens and to Megara
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CITHARA<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (Assyrian <i>chetarah</i>; Gr. <span class="grk" title="kithara">&#954;&#953;&#952;&#940;&#961;&#945;</span>; Lat. <i>cithara</i>; perhaps
Heb. <i>kinura, kinnor</i>), one of the most ancient stringed
instruments, traced back to 1700 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> among the Semitic races,
in Egypt, Assyria, Asia Minor, Greece and the Roman empire,
whence the use of it spread over Europe. The main feature of
the Greek <i>kithara</i>, its shallow sound-chest, being the most
important part of it, is also that in which developments are most
noticeable; its contour varied considerably during the many
musical ages, but the characteristic in respect of which it fore-shadowed
the precursors of the violin family, and by which they
were distinguished from other contemporary stringed instruments
of the middle ages, was preserved throughout in all European
descendants bearing derived names. This <span class="correction" title="amended from characteristc">characteristic</span> box
sound-chest (fig. 1) consisted of two resonating tables, either flat
or delicately arched, connected by ribs or sides of equal width.
The cithara may be regarded as an attempt by a more skilful
craftsman or race to improve upon the lyre (<i>q.v.</i>), while retaining
some of its features. The construction of the cithara can fortunately
be accurately studied from two actual specimens found in
Egypt and preserved in the
museums of Berlin and
Leiden. The Leiden cithara
(fig. 2), which forms part of
the d&rsquo;Anastasy Collection in
the Museum of Antiquities,
is in a very good state of
preservation. The sound-chest,
in the form of an
irregular square (17 cm. &times; 17
cm.), is hollowed out of a
solid block of wood from
the base, which is open;
the little bar, seen through
the open base and measuring
2½ cm. (1 in.), is also of
the same piece of wood.
The arms, one short and
one long, are solid and are
fixed to the body by means
of wooden pins; they are
glued as well for greater
strength. W. Pleyte, through
whose courtesy the sketch
was revised and corrected,
states that there are no
indications on the instrument of any kind of bridge or attachment
for strings except the little half-hoop of iron wire which
passes through the base from back to front. To this the strings
were probably attached, and the little bar performed the double
duty of sound-post and support for strengthening the tail-piece
and enabling it to resist the tension of the strings. The oblique
transverse bar, rendered necessary by the increasing length of
the strings, was characteristic of the
Egyptian cithara,<a name="FnAnchor_1c" id="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> whereas the Asiatic
and Greek instruments were generally
constructed with horizontal bars resting
on arms of equal length, the pitch of the
strings being varied by thickness and
tension, instead of by length. (For the
Berlin cithara see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lyre</a></span>.)</p>

<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>The number of strings with which the
cithara was strung varied from 4 to 19
or 20 at different times; they were
added less for the purpose of increasing
the compass in the modern sense than
to enable the performer to play in the
different modes of the Greek musical
system. Terpander is credited with having
increased the number of strings
to seven; Euclid, quoting him as his
authority, states that &ldquo;loving no more
the tetrachordal chant, we will sing aloud
new hymns to a seven-toned phorminx.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What has been said of the scale of the lyre applies also to the
cithara, and need therefore not be repeated here. The strings
were vibrated by means of the fingers or plectrum (<span class="grk" title="plêktron">&#960;&#955;&#8134;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>,
from <span class="grk" title="plêssein">&#960;&#955;&#942;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to strike; Lat. <i>plectrum</i>, from <i>plango</i>, I strike).
Twanging with the fingers for strings of gut, hemp or silk was
undoubtedly the more artistic method, since the player was able
to command various shades of expression which are impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
with a rigid plectrum.<a name="FnAnchor_2c" id="FnAnchor_2c" href="#Footnote_2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Loudness of accent and great brilliancy
of tone, however, can only be obtained by the use of the plectrum.</p>

<p>Quotations from the classics abound to show what was the
practice of the Greeks and Romans in this respect. The plectrum
was held in the right hand, with elbow outstretched and palm
bent inwards, and the strings were plucked with the straightened
fingers of the left hand.<a name="FnAnchor_3c" id="FnAnchor_3c" href="#Footnote_3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Both methods were used with intention
according to the dictates of art for the sake of the variation in
tone colour obtainable thereby.<a name="FnAnchor_4c" id="FnAnchor_4c" href="#Footnote_4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>The strings of the cithara were either knotted round the
transverse tuning bar itself (<i>zugon</i>) or to rings threaded over
the bar, which enabled the performer to increase or decrease
the tension by shifting the knots or rings; or else they were
wound round pegs,<a name="FnAnchor_5c" id="FnAnchor_5c" href="#Footnote_5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> knobs<a name="FnAnchor_6c" id="FnAnchor_6c" href="#Footnote_6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a> or pins<a name="FnAnchor_7c" id="FnAnchor_7c" href="#Footnote_7c"><span class="sp">7</span></a> fixed to the zugon. The
other end of the strings was secured to a tail-piece after passing
over a flat bridge, or the two were combined in the curious
high box tail-piece which acted as a bridge. Plutarch<a name="FnAnchor_8c" id="FnAnchor_8c" href="#Footnote_8c"><span class="sp">8</span></a> states
that this contrivance was added to the cithara in the days of
Cepion, pupil of Terpander. These boxes were hinged in order
to allow the lid to be opened for the purpose of securing the
strings to some contrivance concealed
therein. It is a curious fact
that no sculptured cithara provided
with this box tail-piece is
represented with strings, and in
many cases there could never have
been any, for the hand and arm<a name="FnAnchor_9c" id="FnAnchor_9c" href="#Footnote_9c"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
are visible across the space that
would be filled by the strings,
which are always carved in a solid
block.</p>

<p>Like the lyre the cithara was
made in many sizes, conditioned
by the pitch and the use to which
the instrument was to be put.
These instruments may have been
distinguished by different names;
the <i>pectis</i>, for instance, is declared
by Sappho (22nd fragment) to
have been small and shrill; the
<i>phorminx</i>, on the other hand, seems
to have been identical with the
cithara.<a name="FnAnchor_10c" id="FnAnchor_10c" href="#Footnote_10c"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>The Greek <i>kithara</i> was the instrument
of the professional singer
or citharoedus (<span class="grk" title="kitharôdos">&#954;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#8179;&#948;&#972;&#962;</span>) and of
the instrumentalist or citharista (<span class="grk" title="kitharistês">&#954;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#962;</span>), and thus served
the double purpose of (1) accompanying the voice&mdash;a use
placed by the Greeks far above mere instrumental music&mdash;in
epic recitations and rhapsodies, in odes and lyric songs;
and (2) of accompanying the dance; it was also used for
playing solos at the national games, at receptions and banquets
and at trials of skill. The costume of the citharoedus and
citharista was rich and recognized as being distinctive; it
varied but little throughout the ages, as may be deduced from
a comparison of representations of the citharoedus on a coin
and on a Greek vase of the best period (fig. 4). The costume
consisted of a <i>palla</i> or long tunic with sleeves embroidered
with gold and girt high above the waist, falling in graceful
folds to the feet. This <i>palla</i> must not be confounded with the
mantle of the same name worn by women. Over one shoulder,
or hanging down the back, was the purple <i>chlamys</i> or cloak,
and on his brow a golden wreath of laurels. All the citharoedi
bear instruments of the type here described as the cithara, and
never one of the lyre type. The records of the citharoedi extend
over more than thirteen centuries and fall into two natural
divisions: (1) The mythological period, approximately from the
13th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to the first Olympiad, 776 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and (2) the
historical period to the days of Ptolemy, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 161. One of the
very few authentic Greek odes extant is a Pythian ode by Pindar,
in which the phorminx of Apollo is mentioned; the solo is followed
by a chorus of citharoedi. The scope of the solemn games and
processions, called <i>Panathenaea</i>, held every four years in honour
of the goddess Athena, which originally consisted principally of
athletic sports and horse and chariot races, was extended under
Peisistratus (c. 540 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and the celebration made to include
contests of singers and instrumentalists, recitations of portions
of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, such as are represented on the frieze
of the Parthenon (in the Elgin Room at the British Museum)
and later on friezes by Pheidias. It was at the same period that
the first contests for solo-playing on the cithara (<span class="grk" title="kitharistus">&#954;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#973;&#962;</span>)
and for solo <i>aulos</i>-playing were instituted at the 8th Pythian
Games.<a name="FnAnchor_11c" id="FnAnchor_11c" href="#Footnote_11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a> One of the
principal items at these
contests for aulos and
cithara was the <i>Nomos
Pythikos</i>, descriptive of
the victory of Apollo
over the python and
of the defeat of the
monster.<a name="FnAnchor_12c" id="FnAnchor_12c" href="#Footnote_12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>The Pythian Games
survived the classic
Greek period and
were continued under
Roman sway until
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 394. Not
only were these games
held at Delphi, but
smaller contests, called
Pythia, modelled on
the great Pythian, were
instituted in various
provinces of the empire,
and more especially
in Asia Minor.
The games lasted for several days, the first being devoted
to music. To the games at Delphi came musicians from
all parts of the civilized world; and the Spaniards, at the
beginning of our era, had attained to such a marvellous proficiency
in playing the cithara, an instrument which they had
learnt to know from the Phoenician colonists before the conquest
by the Romans, that some of their citharoedi easily carried off
the honours at the musical contests. The consul Metellus was
so charmed with the music of the Spanish competitors that he
sent some to Rome for the festivals, where the impression created
was so great that the Spanish citharoedi obtained a permanent
footing in Rome. Aulus Gellius (<i>Noct. Att.</i>) describes an incident
at a banquet which corroborates this statement.</p>

<p>The degeneration of music as an art among the Romans, and its
gradual degradation by association with the sensual amusements
of corrupt Rome, nearly brought about its extinction at the
end of the 4th century, when the condemnation of the Church
closed the theatres, and the great national games came to an end.
Instrumental music was banished from civil life and from
religious rites, and thenceforth the slender threads which connect
the musical instruments of Greeks and Romans with those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
the middle ages must be sought among the unconverted barbarians
of northern and western Europe, who kept alive the
traditions taught them by conquerors and colonists; but as
civilization was in its infancy with them the instruments sent
out from their workshops must have been crude and primitive.
Asia, the cradle of the cithara, also became its foster-mother;
it was among the Greeks of Asia Minor that the several steps
in the transition from cithara into guitar<a name="FnAnchor_13c" id="FnAnchor_13c" href="#Footnote_13c"><span class="sp">13</span></a> (<i>q.v.</i>) took place.</p>

</tr></table>

<p>The first of these steps produced the rotta (<i>q.v.</i>), by the
construction of body, arms and transverse bar in one piece.
The Semitic races used the rotta at a very remote period (1700
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), as we know from a fresco at Beni-Hasan, dating from the
reign of Senwosri II., which depicts a procession of strangers
bringing tribute; among them is a bearded musician of Semitic
type bearing a rotta which he holds horizontally in front of him
in the Assyrian manner, and quite unlike the Greeks, who always
played the lyre and cithara in an upright position. A unique
specimen of this rectangular rotta was found in an Alamannic
tomb of the 5th or 6th century at Oberflacht in the Black Forest.
The instrument was clasped in the arms of an armed knight;
it is now preserved in the Völker Museum in Berlin. This old
German rotta is an exact counterpart of instruments pictured in
illuminated MSS. of the 8th century, and is derived from the
cithara with rectangular
body, while
from the cithara with
a body having the
curve of the lower
half of the violin was
produced a rotta with
the outline of the
body of the guitar.
Both types were
common in Europe
until the 14th century,
some played
with a bow, others
twanged by the
fingers, and bearing
indifferently both
names, cithara and
rotta. The addition
of  a  finger-board,
stretching like a short neck from body to transverse bar,
leaving on each side of the finger-board space for the hand to pass
through in order to stop the strings, produced the crwth or crowd
(<i>q.v.</i>), and brought about the reduction in the number of the
strings to three or four. The conversion of the rotta into the
guitar (<i>q.v.</i>) was an easy transition effected by the addition of a
long neck to a body derived from the oval rotta. When the bow
was applied the result was the guitar or troubadour fiddle. At
first the instrument called <i>cithara</i> in the Latin versions of the
Psalms was glossed <i>citran, citre</i> in Anglo-Saxon, but in the 11th
century the same instrument was rendered <i>hearpan</i>, and in
French and English <i>harpe</i> or <i>harp</i>, and our modern versions
have retained this translation. The <i>cittern</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), a later
descendant of the cithara, although preserving the characteristic
features of the cithara, the shallow sound-chest with ribs, adopted
the pear-shaped outline of the Eastern instruments of the lute
tribe.</p>

from E. and W. meet and pass seawards off Cape Kiti a few miles
south, and greatly facilitated ancient trade. To S. and W. the

an Aegean colony.<a name="FnAnchor_1d" id="FnAnchor_1d" href="#Footnote_1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but in historic times Citium is the chief
centre of Phoenician influence in Cyprus. That this was still a
recent settlement in the 7th century is suggested by an allusion
in a list of the allies of Assur-bani-pal of Assyria in 668 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to a
King Damasu of &#310;artihadasti (Phoenician for &ldquo;New-town&rdquo;),
where Citium would be expected. A Phoenician dedication to
&ldquo;Baal of Lebanon&rdquo; found here, and dated also to the 7th
century, suggests that Citium may have belonged to Tyre. The
biblical name Kittim, derived from Citium, is in fact used quite
generally for Cyprus as a whole;<a name="FnAnchor_2d" id="FnAnchor_2d" href="#Footnote_2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> later also for Greeks and
Romans in general.<a name="FnAnchor_3d" id="FnAnchor_3d" href="#Footnote_3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The discovery here of an official monument
of Sargon II. suggests that Citium was the administrative centre
of Cyprus during the Assyrian protectorate (700-668 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).<a name="FnAnchor_4d" id="FnAnchor_4d" href="#Footnote_4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
During the Greek revolts of 500, 386 foll. and 352 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, Citium
led the side loyal to Persia and was besieged by an Athenian
force in 449 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; its extensive necropolis proves that it remained
a considerable city even after the Greek cause triumphed with
Alexander. But like other cities of Cyprus, it suffered repeatedly
from earthquake, and in medieval times when its harbour became
silted the population moved to Larnaca, on the open roadstead,
farther south. Harbour and citadel have now quite disappeared,
the latter having been used to fill up the former shortly after the
British occupation; some gain to health resulted, but an
irreparable loss to science. Traces remain of the circuit wall,
and of a sanctuary with copious terra-cotta offerings; the large
necropolis yields constant loot to illicit excavation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CITIZEN<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (a form corrupted in Eng., apparently by analogy with &ldquo;denizen,&rdquo;
from O. Fr. <i>citeain</i>, mod. Fr. <i>citoyen</i>), etymologically
the inhabitant of a city, <i>cité</i> or <i>civitas</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">City</a></span>),
and in England the term still used primarily of persons possessing
civic rights in a borough; thus used also of a townsman as
opposed to a countryman. The more extended use of the word,
however, corresponding to <i>civitas</i>, gives &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; the meaning
of one who is a constituent member of a state in international
relations and as such has full national rights and owes a certain
allegiance (<i>q.v.</i>) as opposed to an &ldquo;alien&rdquo;; in republican countries
the term is then commonly employed as the equivalent of
&ldquo;subject&rdquo; in monarchies of feudal origin. For the rules governing
the obtaining of citizenship in this latter sense in the United
States and elsewhere see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Naturalization</a></span>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CITOLE<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span>, also spelled <span class="sc">Sytole, Cythole, Gytolle</span>, &amp;c. (probably
a Fr. diminutive form of <i>cithara</i>, and not from Lat. <i>cista</i>,
a box), an obsolete musical instrument of which the exact form
is uncertain. It is frequently mentioned by poetical writers of
the 13th to the 15th centuries, and is found in Wycliffe&rsquo;s Bible
(1360) in 2 Samuel vi. 5, &ldquo;Harpis and sitols and tympane.&rdquo;
The Authorized Version has &ldquo;psaltiries,&rdquo; and the Vulgate

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CITRIC ACID<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span>, <i>Acidum citricum</i>, or <span class="sc">Oxytricarballylic Acid</span>,
C<span class="su">3</span>H<span class="su">4</span>(OH) (CO·OH)<span class="su">3</span>, a tetrahydroxytribasic acid, first obtained
in the solid state by Karl Wilhelm Scheele, in 1784, from the juice
of lemons. It is present also in oranges, citrons, currants,
gooseberries and many other fruits, and in several bulbs and tubers.
It is made on a large scale from lime or lemon juice, and also by
the fermentation of glucose under the influence of <i>Citromycetes
pfefferianus, C. glaber</i> and other ferments. Lemon juice is
fermented for some time to free it from mucilage, then boiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
and filtered, and neutralized with powdered chalk and a little
milk of lime; the precipitate of calcium citrate so obtained
is decomposed with dilute sulphuric acid, the solution filtered,
evaporated to remove calcium sulphate and concentrated, preferably
in vacuum pans. The acid is thus obtained in colourless
rhombic prisms of the composition C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">8</span>O<span class="su">7</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>O. Crystals
of a different form are deposited from a strong boiling solution
of the acid. About 20 gallons of lemon juice should yield about
10 lb of crystallized citric acid. The acid may also be prepared
from the juice of unripe gooseberries. Calcium citrate must be
manufactured with care to avoid an excess of chalk or lime,
which would precipitate constituents of the juice that cause the
fermentation of the citrate and the production of calcium acetate
and butyrate.</p>

<p>The synthesis of citric acid was accomplished by L.E.
Grimaux and P. Adam in 1881. Glycerin when treated with
hydrochloric acid gives propenyl dichlorhydrin, which may be
oxidized to s-dichloracetone. This compound combines with
hydrocyanic acid to form a nitrile which hydrolyses to dichlor-hydroxy
iso-butyric acid. Potassium cyanide reacts with this
acid to form the corresponding dinitrile, which is converted by
hydrochloric acid into citric acid. This series of operations
proves the constitution of the acid. A. Haller and C.A. Held
synthesized the acid from ethyl chlor-acetoacetate (from chlorine
and acetoacetic ester) by heating with potassium cyanide and
saponifying the resulting nitrile. The acetone dicarboxylic
acid, CO(CH<span class="su">2</span>CO<span class="su">2</span>H)<span class="su">2</span>, so obtained combines with hydrocyanic
acid, and this product yields citric acid on hydrolysis.</p>

<p>Citric acid has an agreeable sour taste. It is soluble in ¾ths
of its weight of cold, and in half its weight of boiling water, and
dissolves in alcohol, but not in ether. At 150°C. it melts, and on
the continued application of heat boils, giving off its water of
crystallization. At 175° C. it is resolved into water and aconitic
acid, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">6</span>O<span class="su">6</span>, a substance found in <i>Equisetum fluviatile</i>,
monks-hood and other plants. A higher temperature decomposes this
body into carbon dioxide and itaconic acid, C<span class="su">5</span>H<span class="su">6</span>C<span class="su">4</span>, which,
again, by the expulsion of a molecule of water, yields citraconic
anhydride, C<span class="su">5</span>H<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">3</span>. Citric acid digested at a temperature
below 40°C. with concentrated sulphuric acid gives off carbon
monoxide and forms acetone dicarboxylic acid. With fused
potash it forms potassium oxalate and acetate. It is a strong
acid, and dissolved in water decomposes carbonates and attacks
iron and zinc.</p>

<p>The citrates are a numerous class of salts, the most soluble
of which are those of the alkaline metals; the citrates of the
alkaline earth metals are insoluble. Citric acid, being tribasic,
forms either acid monometallic, acid dimetallic or neutral
trimetallic salts; thus, mono-, di- and tri-potassium and sodium
citrates are known. On warming citric acid with an excess of
lime-water a precipitate of calcium citrate is obtained which is
redissolved as the liquid cools.</p>

<p>The impurities occasionally present in commercial citric acid
are salts of potassium and sodium, traces of iron, lead and copper
derived from the vessels used for its evaporation and crystallization,
and free sulphuric, tartaric and even oxalic acid. Tartaric
acid, which is sometimes present in large quantities as an adulterant
in commercial citric acid, may be detected in the presence
of the latter, by the production of a precipitate of acid potassium
tartrate when potassium acetate is added to a cold solution.
Another mode of separating the two acids is to convert them
into calcium salts, which are then treated with a perfectly
neutral solution of cupric chloride, soluble cupric citrate and
calcium chloride being formed, while cupric tartrate remains
undissolved. Citric acid is also distinguished from tartaric
acid by the fact that an ammonia solution of silver tartrate
produces a brilliant silver mirror when boiled, whereas silver
citrate is reduced only after prolonged ebullition.</p>

<p>Citric acid is used in calico printing, also in the preparation
of effervescing draughts, as a refrigerant and sialogogue, and
occasionally as an antiscorbutic, instead of fresh lemon juice.
In the form of lime juice it has long been known as an antidote for
scurvy. Several of the citrates are much employed as medicines,
the most important being the scale preparations of iron. Of
these iron and ammonium citrate is much used as a haematinic,
and as it has hardly any tendency to cause gastric irritation or
constipation it can be taken when the ordinary forms of iron are
inadmissible. Iron and quinine citrate is used as a bitter
stomachic and tonic. In the blood citrates are oxidized into
carbonates; they therefore act as <i>remote alkalis</i>, increasing the
alkalinity of the blood and thereby the general rate of chemical
change within the body (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Acetic Acid</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CITRON<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span>, a species of <i>Citrus</i> (<i>C. medica</i>), belonging to the tribe
<i>Aurantieae</i>, of the botanical natural order Rutaceae; the same
genus furnishes also the orange, lime and shaddock. The citron
is a small evergreen tree or shrub growing to a height of about
10 ft.; it has irregular straggling spiny branches, large pale-green
broadly oblong, slightly serrate leaves and generally unisexual
flowers purplish without and white within. The large fruit is
ovate or oblong, protuberant at the tip, and from 5 to 6 in. long,
with a rough, furrowed, adherent rind, the inner portion of which
is thick, white and fleshy, the outer, thin, greenish-yellow and
very fragrant. The pulp is sub-acid and edible, and the seeds
are bitter. There are many varieties of the fruit, some of them
of great weight and size. The Madras citron has the form of an
oblate sphere; and in the &ldquo;fingered citron&rdquo; of China the lobes
are separated into finger-like divisions formed by separation
of the constituent carpels, as occurs sometimes in the orange.</p>

<p>The citron-tree thrives in the open air in China, Persia, the
West Indies, Madeira, Sicily, Corsica, and the warmer parts of
Spain and Italy; and in conservatories it is often to be seen
in more northerly regions. Sir Joseph Hooker (<i>Flora of British
India</i>, i. 514) regards it as a native of the valleys at the
foot of the Himalaya, and of the Khasia hills and the Western
Ghauts; Dr Bonavia, however, considers it to have originated
in Cochin China or China, and to have been introduced into
India, whence it spread to Media and Persia. It was described
by Theophrastus as growing in Media, three centuries before
Christ, and was early known to the ancients, and the fruit was
held in great esteem by them; but they seem to have been acquainted
with no other member of the <i>Aurantieae</i>, the introduction
of oranges and lemons into the countries of the Mediterranean
being due to the Arabs, between the 10th and 15th centuries.
Josephus tells us that &ldquo;the law of the Jews required that at the
feast of tabernacles every one should have branches of palm-tree
and citron-tree&rdquo; (<i>Antiq.</i> xiii. 13. 5); and the Hebrew
word <i>tappuach</i>, rendered &ldquo;apples&rdquo; and &ldquo;apple-tree&rdquo; in Cant. ii.
3, 5, Prov. xxv. 11, &amp;c., probably signifies the citron-tree and
its fruit. Oribasius in the 4th century describes the fruit,
accurately distinguishing the three parts of it. About the 3rd
century the tree was introduced into Italy; and, as Gallesio
informs us, it was much grown at Salerno in the 11th century.
In China citrons are placed in apartments to make them fragrant.
The rind of the citron yields two perfumes, <i>oil of cedra</i> and
<i>oil of citron</i>, isomeric with oil of turpentine; and when candied
it is much esteemed as a dessert and in confectionery. The lemon
(<i>q.v.</i>) is now generally regarded as a subspecies <i>Limonum</i> of
<i>Citrus medica</i>.</p>

(18 m. direct), situated on the left bank of the Tiber, 945 ft.
above sea-level. Pop. (1901) of town, 6096; of commune,
26,885. It occupies, as inscriptions show, the site of the ancient

cf. H. Winnefeld in <i>Jahrbuch des deutschen archäologischen
Instituts</i>, vi. Berlin, 1891, 203), but no remains exist above
ground. The town was devastated by Totila, but seems to have
recovered. We find it under the name of <i>Castrum Felicitatis</i>
at the end of the 8th century. The bishopric dates from the
7th century. The town went through various political vicissitudes
in the middle ages, being subject now to the emperor,
now to the Church, until in 1468 it came under the Vitelli:
but when they died out it returned to the allegiance of the
Church. It is built in the form of a rectangle and surrounded
by walls of 1518. It contains fine buildings of the Renaissance,
especially the palaces of the Vitelli, and the cathedral, originally
Romanesque. The 12th-century altar front of the latter in
silver is fine. The Palazzo Comunale is of the 14th century.
Some of Raphael&rsquo;s earliest works were painted for churches in
this town, but none of them remains there. There is, however,
a small collection of pictures.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CITTÀ VECCHIA<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Città Notabile</span>, a fortified city of
Malta, 7 m. W. of Valletta, with which it is connected by railway.
Pop. (1901) 7515. It lies on high, sharply rising ground which
affords a view of a large part of the island. It is the seat of a
bishop, and contains an ornate cathedral, overthrown by an
earthquake in 1693, but rebuilt, which is said by an acceptable
tradition to occupy the site of the house of the governor Publius,
who welcomed the apostle Paul. It contains some rich stalls
of the 15th century and other objects of interest. In the rock
beneath the city there are some remarkable catacombs in part
of pre-Christian origin, but containing evidence of early Christian
burial; and a grotto, reputed to have given shelter to the apostle,
is pointed out below the church of San Paolo. Remains of
Roman buildings have been excavated in the town. About
2 m. E. of the town is the residence of the English governor,
known as the palace of S. Antonio; and at a like distance to
the south is the ancient palace of the grand masters of the order
of St John, with an extensive public garden called Il Boschetto.
Città Vecchia was called Civitas Melita by the Romans and
oldest writers, Medina (<i>i.e.</i> the city) by the Saracens, Notabile
(<i>locale notabile, et insigne coronae regiae</i>, as it is called
in a charter by Alphonso, 1428) under the Sicilian rule,

<p><span class="bold">CITTERN<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (also <span class="sc">Cithern, Cithron, Cythren, Citharen</span>, &amp;c.;
Fr. <i>citre, cistre, cithre, guitare allemande</i> or <i>anglaise</i>; Ger. <i>Cither</i>,
Zither (<i>mit Hals</i>, with neck); Ital. <i>cetera, cetra</i>), a medieval
stringed instrument with a neck terminating in a grotesque and
twanged by fingers or plectrum. The popularity of the cittern
was at its height in England and Germany during the 16th and

<span class="figleft1" style="float: left">

17th centuries. The cittern consisted
of a pear-shaped body
similar to that of the lute but
with a flat back and sound-board
joined by ribs. The neck was provided with a fretted finger-board;
the head was curved and surmounted by a grotesque
head of a woman or of an animal.<a name="FnAnchor_1e" id="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a>  The strings were of wire in
pairs of unisons, known as courses, usually four in number in
England. A peculiarity of the cittern lay in the tuning of the
courses, the third course known as bass being lower than the
fourth styled tenor.</p>

<p>According to Vincentio Galilei (the father of the great astronomer)
England was the birthplace of the cittern.<a name="FnAnchor_2e" id="FnAnchor_2e" href="#Footnote_2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Several
lesson books for this popular instrument were published during
the 17th century in England. A very rare book (of which the
British Museum does not possess a copy), <i>The Cittharn Schoole</i>,
written by Anthony Holborne in 1597, is mentioned in Sir
P. Leycester&rsquo;s manuscript commonplace book<a name="FnAnchor_3e" id="FnAnchor_3e" href="#Footnote_3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a> dated 1656,
&ldquo;For the little Instrument called a <i>Psittyrne</i> Anthony Holborne
and Tho. Robinson were most famous of any before them and
have both of them set out a booke of Lessons for this Instrument.
Holborne has composed a Basse-parte for the Viole to play unto
the Psittyrne with those Lessons set out in his booke. These
lived about Anno Domini 1600.&rdquo; Thomas Robinson&rsquo;s <i>New
Citharen Lessons with perfect tunings for the same from Foure course
of strings to Fourteene course</i>, &amp;c. (printed London, 1609, by
William Barley), contains illustrations of both kinds of instruments.
The fourteen-course cittern was also known in England
as <i>Bijuga</i>; the seven courses in pairs were stretched over the
finger-board, and the seven single strings,
fastened to the grotesque
head, were stretched as in the lyre <i>à vide</i> alongside the
neck; all the strings rested on the one flat bridge near the tail-piece.
Robinson gives instructions for learning to play the
cittern and for reading the tablature. John Playford&rsquo;s <i>Musick&rsquo;s
Delight on the Cithren</i> (London, 1666) also contains illustrations
of the instrument as well as of the viol da Gamba and Pochette;
he claims to have revived the instrument and restored it to what
it was in the reign of Queen Mary.</p>

<p class="pt2">The cittern probably owed its popularity at this time to the
ease with which it might be mastered and used to accompany
the voice; it was one of four instruments generally found in
barbers&rsquo; shops, the others being the gittern, the lute and the
virginals. The customers while waiting took down the instrument
from its peg and played a merry tune to pass the time.<a name="FnAnchor_4e" id="FnAnchor_4e" href="#Footnote_4e"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
We read that when Konstantijn Huygens came over to England
and was received by James I. at Bagshot, he played to the
king on the cittern (cithara), and that his performance was
duly appreciated and applauded. He tells us that, although he
learnt to play the barbiton in a few weeks with skill, he had
lessons from a master for two years on the cittern.<a name="FnAnchor_5e" id="FnAnchor_5e" href="#Footnote_5e"><span class="sp">5</span></a> On the
occasion of a third visit he witnessed the performance of some
fine musicians and was astonished to hear a lady, mother of
twelve, singing in divine fashion, accompanying herself on the
cittern; one of these artists he calls Lanivius, the British
Orpheus, whose performance was really enchanting.</p>

<p>Michael Praetorius<a name="FnAnchor_6e" id="FnAnchor_6e" href="#Footnote_6e"><span class="sp">6</span></a> gives various tunings for the cittern as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>

<p>During the 18th century the cittern, citra or English guitar,
had twelve wire strings in six pairs of unisons tuned thus:</p>

<p>The introduction of the Spanish guitar, which at once leapt
into favour, gradually displaced the English variety. The
Spanish guitar had gut strings twanged by the fingers. The
last development of the cittern before its disappearance was the
addition of keys. The keyed cithara<a name="FnAnchor_7e" id="FnAnchor_7e" href="#Footnote_7e"><span class="sp">7</span></a> was first made by Claus
&amp; Co. of London in 1783. The keys, six in number, were
placed on the left of the sound-board, and on being depressed
they acted on hammers inside the sound-chest, which rising
through the rose sound-hole struck the strings. Sometimes
the keys were placed in a little box right over the strings, the
hammers striking from above. M.J.B. Vuillaume of Paris
possessed an Italian cetera (not keyed) by Antoine Stradivarius,<a name="FnAnchor_8e" id="FnAnchor_8e" href="#Footnote_8e"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
1700 (now in the Museum of the Conservatoire, Paris), with
twelve strings tuned in pairs of unisons to E, D, G, B, C, A,
which was exhibited in London in 1871.</p>

<p>The cittern of the 16th century was the result of certain
transitions which took place during the evolution of the violin
from the Greek kithara (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cithara</a></span>).</p>

<p>The cittern has retained the following characteristics of the
archetype. (1) The derivation of the name, which after the
introduction of the bow was used to characterize various instruments
whose strings were twanged by fingers or plectrum, such
as the harp and the rotta (both known as <i>cithara</i>), the citola and
the zither. In an interlinear Latin and Anglo-Saxon version
of the Psalms, dated <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 700 (Brit. Mus., Vesp. A. 1), <i>cithara</i>
is translated <i>citran</i>, from which it is not difficult to trace the
English <i>cithron, citteran, cittarn</i>, of the 16th century. (2) The
construction of the sound-chest with flat back and sound-board
connected by ribs. The pear-shaped outline was possibly
borrowed from the Eastern instruments, both bowed as the
rebab and twanged as the lute, so common all over Europe
during the middle ages, or more probably derived from the
<i>kithara</i> of the Greeks of Asia Minor, which had the corners
rounded. These early steps in the transition from the <i>cithara</i>
may be seen in the miniatures of the Utrecht Psalter,<a name="FnAnchor_9e" id="FnAnchor_9e" href="#Footnote_9e"><span class="sp">9</span></a> a unique
and much-copied Carolingian MS. executed at Reims (9th
century), the illustrations of which were undoubtedly adapted
from an earlier psalter from the Christian East. The instruments
which remained true to the prototype in outline as well as in
construction and in the derivation of the name were the ghittern
and the guitar, so often confused with the cittern. It is evident
that the kinship of cittern and guitar was formerly recognized,
for during the 18th century, as stated above, the cittern was
known as the English guitar to distinguish it from the Spanish
guitar. The grotesque head, popularly considered the characteristic
feature of the cittern, was probably added in the 12th
century at a time when this style of decoration was very noticeable
in other musical instruments, such as the cornet or <i>Zinck</i>, the
<i>Platerspiel</i>, the chaunter of the bagpipe, &amp;c. The cittern of the
middle ages was also to be found in oval shape. From the 13th
century representations of the pear-shaped instrument abound in
miniatures and carvings.<a name="FnAnchor_10e" id="FnAnchor_10e" href="#Footnote_10e"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p><span class="bold">CITY<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (through Fr. <i>cité</i>, from Lat. <i>civitas</i>). In the United
Kingdom, strictly speaking, &ldquo;city&rdquo; is an honorary title, officially
applied to those towns which, in virtue of some preeminence
(<i>e.g.</i> as episcopal sees, or great industrial centres), have by
traditional usage or royal charter acquired the right to the
designation. In the United Kingdom the official style of &ldquo;city&rdquo;
does not necessarily involve the possession of municipal power
greater than those of the ordinary boroughs, nor indeed the
possession of a corporation at all (<i>e.g.</i> Ely). In the United
States and the British colonies, on the other hand, the official
application of the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; depends on the kind and extent
of the municipal privileges possessed by the corporations, and
charters are given raising towns to the rank of cities. Both in
France and England the word is used to distinguish the older
and central nucleus of some of the large towns, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Cité</i> in
Paris, and the &ldquo;square mile&rdquo; under the jurisdiction of the lord
mayor which is the &ldquo;City of London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In common usage, however, the word implies no more than a
somewhat vague idea of size and dignity, and is loosely applied
to any large centre of population. Thus while, technically,
the City of London is quite small, London is yet properly described
as the largest city in the world. In the United States
this use of the word is still more loose, and any town, whether
technically a city or not, is usually so designated, with little
regard to its actual size or importance.</p>

<p>It is clear from the above that the word &ldquo;city&rdquo; is incapable
of any very clear and inclusive definition, and the attempt to
show that historically it possesses a meaning that clearly differentiates
it from &ldquo;town&rdquo; or &ldquo;borough&rdquo; has led to some controversy.
As the translation of the Greek <span class="grk" title="polis">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;</span> or Latin <i>civitas</i>
it involves the ancient conception of the state or &ldquo;city-state,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> of the state as not too large to prevent its government
through the body of the citizens assembled in the <i>agora</i>, and is
applied not to the place but to the whole body politic. From
this conception both the word and its dignified connotation are
without doubt historically derived. On the occupation of Gaul
the Gallic states and tribes were called <i>civitates</i> by the Romans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
and subsequently the name was confined to the chief towns of
the various administrative districts. These were also the seats
of the bishops. It is thus affirmed that in France from the 5th
to the 15th century the name <i>civitas</i> or <i>cité</i> was confined to such
towns as were episcopal sees, and Du Cange (<i>Gloss.</i> s.v. <i>civitas</i>)
defines that word as <i>urbs episcopalis</i>, and states that other
towns were termed <i>castra</i> or <i>oppida</i>. How far any such
distinction can be sharply drawn may be doubted. With regard to
England no definite line can be drawn between those towns
to which the name <i>civitas</i> or <i>cité</i> is given in medieval documents
and those called <i>burgi</i> or boroughs (see J.H. Round, <i>Feudal
England</i>, p. 338; F.W. Maitland, <i>Domesday Book and After</i>,
p. 183). It was, however, maintained by Coke and Blackstone
that a city is a town incorporate which is or has been the see
of a bishop. It is true, indeed, that the actual sees in England
all have a formal right to the title; the boroughs erected into
episcopal sees by Henry VIII. thereby became &ldquo;cities&rdquo;; but
towns such as Thetford, Sherborne and Dorchester are never
so designated, though they are regularly incorporated and were
once episcopal sees. On the other hand, it has only been since
the latter part of the 19th century that the official style of &ldquo;city&rdquo;
has, in the United Kingdom, been conferred by royal authority
on certain important towns which were not episcopal sees,
Birmingham in 1889 being the first to be so distinguished. It
is interesting to note that London, besides 27 boroughs, now
contains two cities, one (the City of London) outside, the other
(the City of Westminster) included in the administrative county.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD BOLÍVAR<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span>, an inland city and river port of Venezuela,
capital of the state of Bolívar, on the right bank of the Orinoco
river, 240 m. above its mouth. Pop. (1891) 11,686. It stands
upon a small hill about 187 ft. above sea-level, and faces the
river where it narrows to a width of less than half a mile. The
city is largely built upon the hillside. It is the seat of the
bishopric of Guayana (founded in 1790), and is the commercial
centre of the great Orinoco basin. Among its noteworthy edifices
are the cathedral, federal college, theatre, masonic temple,
market, custom-house, and hospital. The mean temperature
is 83°. The city has a public water-supply, a tramway line,
telephone service, subfluvial cable communication with Soledad
near the mouth of the Orinoco, where connexion is made with the
national land lines, and regular steamship communication with
the lower and upper Orinoco. Previous to the revolution of
1901-3 Ciudad Bolívar ranked fourth among the Venezuelan
custom-houses, but the restrictions placed upon transit trade
through West Indian ports have made her a dependency of the
La Guaira custom-house to a large extent. The principal exports
from this region include cattle, horses, mules, tobacco, cacáo,
rubber, tonka beans, bitters, hides, timber and many valuable
forest products. The town was founded by Mendoza in 1764 as
San Tomás de la Nueva Guayana, but its location at this particular
point on the river gave to it the popular name of <i>Angostura</i>,
the Spanish term for &ldquo;narrows.&rdquo; This name was used until
1849, when that of the Venezuelan liberator was bestowed upon
it. Ciudad Bolívar played an important part in the struggle for
independence and was for a time the headquarters of the revolution.
The town suffered severely in the struggle for its possession,
and the political disorders which followed greatly retarded its
growth.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD DE CURA<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span>, an inland town of the state of Aragua,
Venezuela, 55 m. S.W. of Carácas, near the Lago de Valencia.
Pop. (1891) 12,198. The town stands in a broad, fertile valley,
between the sources of streams running southward to the Guárico
river and northward to the lake, with an elevation above sea-level
of 1598 ft. Traffic between Puerto Cabello and the Guárico
plains has passed through this town since early colonial times,
and has made it an important commercial centre, from which
hides, cheese, coffee, cacao and beans are sent down to the coast
for export; it bears a high reputation in Venezuela for commercial
enterprise. Ciudad de Cura was founded in 1730, and suffered
severely in the war of independence.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD JUAREZ<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span>, formerly <span class="sc">El Paso del Norte</span>, a northern
frontier town of Mexico, in the state of Chihuahua, 1223 m. by
rail N.N.W. of Mexico City. Pop. (1895) 6917. Ciudad Juarez
stands 3800 ft. above sea-level on the right bank of the Rio
Grande del Norte, opposite the city of El Paso, Texas, with which
it is connected by two bridges. It is the northern terminus of
the Mexican Central railway, and has a large and increasing
transit trade with the United States, having a custom-house
and a United States consulate. It is also a military post with a
small garrison. The town has a straggling picturesque appearance,
a considerable part of the habitations being small adobe
or brick cabins. In the fertile neighbouring district cattle are
raised, and wheat, Indian corn, fruit and grapes are grown, wine
and brandy being made. The town was founded in 1681-1682;
its present importance is due entirely to the railway. It was the
headquarters of President Juarez in 1865, and was renamed
in 1885 because of its devotion to his cause.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD PORFIRIO DIAZ<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span>, formerly <span class="sc">Piedras Negras</span>, a
northern frontier town of Mexico in the state of Coahuila, 1008 m.
N. by W. from Mexico City, on the Rio Grande del Norte, 720 ft.
above sea-level, opposite the town of Eagle Pass, Texas. Pop.
(1900, estimate) 5000. An international bridge connects the two
towns, and the Mexican International railway has its northern
terminus in Mexico at this point. The town has an important
transfer trade with the United States, and is the centre of a
fertile district devoted to agriculture and stock-raising. Coal is
found in the vicinity. The Mexican government maintains a
custom-house and military post here. The town was founded
in 1849.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD REAL<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span>, a province of central Spain, formed in 1833
of districts taken from New Castile, and bounded on the N.
by Toledo, E. by Albacete, S. by Jaen and Cordova and W. by
Badajoz. Pop. (1900) 321,580; area, 7620 sq. m. The surface
of Ciudad Real consists chiefly of a level or slightly undulating
plain, with low hills in the north-east and south-west; but along
the south-western frontier the Sierra de Alcudia rises in two
parallel ridges on either side of the river Alcudia, and is continued
in the Sierra Madrona on the east. The river Guadiana drains
almost the entire province, which it traverses from east to west;
only the southernmost districts being watered by tributaries of
the Guadalquivir. Numerous smaller streams flow into the
Guadiana, which itself divides near Herencia into two branches,&mdash;the
northern known as the Giguela, the southern as the Zancara.
The eastern division of Ciudad Real forms part of the region
known as La Mancha, a flat, thinly-peopled plain, clothed with
meagre vegetation which is often ravaged by locusts. La Mancha
(<i>q.v.</i>) is sometimes regarded as coextensive with the whole province.
Severe drought is common here, although some of the
rivers, such as the Jabalon and Azuer, issue fully formed from
the chalky soil, and from their very sources give an abundant
supply of water to the numerous mills. Towards the west, where
the land is higher, there are considerable tracts of forest.</p>

<p>The climate is oppressively hot in summer, and in winter the
plains are exposed to violent and bitterly cold winds; while the
cultivation of grain, the vine and the olive is further impeded
by the want of proper irrigation, and the general barrenness of
the soil. Large flocks of sheep and goats find pasture in the
plains; and the swine which are kept in the oak and beech
forests furnish bacon and hams of excellent quality. Coal is
mined chiefly at Puertollano, lead in various districts, mercury
at Almadén. There are no great manufacturing towns. The
roads are insufficient and ill-kept, especially in the north-east
where they form the sole means of communication; and neither
the Guadiana nor its tributaries are navigable. The main railway
from Madrid to Lisbon passes through the capital, Ciudad Real,
and through Puertollano; farther east, the Madrid-Lináres line
passes through Manzanares and Valdepeñas. Branch railways
also connect the capital with Manzanares, and Valdepeñas with
the neighbouring town of La Calzada.</p>

<p>The principal towns, Alcázar de San Juan (11,499), Almadén
(7375), Almodóvar del Campo (12,525), Ciudad Real (15,255),
Manzanares (11,229) and Valdepeñas (21,015), are described in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
separate articles. Almagro (7974) and Daimiel (11,825), in the
district of La Mancha known as the Campo de Calatrava, belonged
in the later middle ages to the knightly Order of Calatrava,
which was founded in 1158 to keep the Moors in check. Almagro
was long almost exclusively inhabited by monks and knights, and
contains several interesting churches and monasteries, besides
the castle of the knights, now used as barracks. Almagro is
further celebrated for its lace, Daimiel for its medicinal salts.
Tomelloso (13,929) is one of the chief market towns of La Mancha.
Education is very backward, largely owing to the extreme poverty
which has frequently brought the inhabitants to the verge of
famine. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Castile</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD REAL<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span>, the capital formerly of La Mancha, and
since 1833 of the province described above; 107 m. S. of Madrid,
on the Madrid-Badajoz-Lisbon and Ciudad Real-Manzanares
railways. Pop. (1900) 15,255. Ciudad Real lies in the midst
of a wide plain, watered on the north by the river Guadiana,
and on the south by its tributary the Jabalon. Apart from the
remnants of its 13th-century fortifications, and one Gothic
church of immense size, built without aisles, the town contains
little of interest; its public buildings&mdash;town-hall, barracks,
churches, hospital and schools&mdash;being in no way distinguished
above those of other provincial capitals. There are no important
local manufactures, and the trade of the town consists chiefly
in the weekly sales of <span class="correction" title="amended from agricultrual">agricultrural</span> produce and live-stock.
Ciudad Real was founded by Alphonso X. of Castile (1252-1284),
and fortified by him as a check upon the Moorish power. Its
original name of <i>Villarreal</i> was changed to <i>Ciudad Real</i> by John
VI. in 1420. During the Peninsular War a Spanish force was
defeated here by the French, on the 27th of March 1809.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIUDAD RODRIGO<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span>, a town of western Spain, in the province
of Salamanca, situated 8 m. E. of the Portuguese frontier, on
the right bank of the river Agueda, and the railway from
Salamanca to Coimbra in Portugal. Pop. (1900) 8930. Ciudad
Rodrigo is an episcopal see, and was for many centuries an
important frontier fortress. Its cathedral dates from 1190,
but was restored in the 15th century. The remnants of a Roman
aqueduct, the foundations of a bridge across the Agueda, and
other remains, seem to show that Ciudad Rodrigo occupies the
site of a Roman settlement. It was founded in the 12th century
by Count Rodrigo Gonzalez, from whom its name is derived.
During the Peninsular War, it was captured by the French
under Marshal Ney, in 1810; but on the 19th of January 1812
it was retaken by the British under Viscount Wellington, who,
for this exploit, was created earl of Wellington, duke of Ciudad
Rodrigo, and marquess of Torres Vedras, in Portugal.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIVERCHIO, VINCENZO<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span>, an early 16th-century Italian painter,

at Crema the altar-piece at the duomo (1509). His &ldquo;Birth of
Christ&rdquo; is in the Brera, Milan; and at Lovere are other of
his works dating from 1539 and 1540.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIVET<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span>, or properly <span class="sc">Civet-cat</span>, the designation of the more
typical representatives of the mammalian family <i>Viverridae</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>). Civets are characterized by the possession
of a deep pouch in the neighbourhood of the genital organs,
into which the substance known as civet is poured from the
glands by which it is secreted. This fatty substance is at first
semifluid and yellow, but afterwards acquires the consistency
of pomade and becomes darker. It has a strong musky odour,
exceedingly disagreeable to those unaccustomed to it, but &ldquo;when
properly diluted and combined with other scents it produces
a very pleasing effect, and possesses a much more floral fragrance
than musk, indeed it would be impossible to imitate some
flowers without it.&rdquo; The African civet (<i>Viverra civetta</i>) is from
2 to 3 ft. in length, exclusive of the tail, which is half the length
of the body, and stands from 10 to 12 in. high. It is covered
with long hair, longest on the middle line of the back, where it
is capable of being raised or depressed at will, of a dark-grey
colour, with numerous transverse black bands and spots. In
habits it is chiefly nocturnal, and by preference carnivorous,
feeding on birds and the smaller quadrupeds, in pursuit of which
it climbs trees, but it is said also to eat fruits, roots and other
vegetable matters. In a state of captivity the civet is never
completely tamed, and only kept for the sake of its perfume,
which is obtained in largest quantity from the male, especially
when in good condition and subjected to irritation, being scraped
from the pouch with a small spoon usually twice a week. The
zibeth (<i>Viverra zibetha</i>) is a widely distributed species extending
from Arabia to Malabar, and throughout several of the larger
islands of the Indian Archipelago. It is smaller than the true
civet, and wants the dorsal crest. In the wild state it does
great damage among poultry, and frequently makes off with
the young of swine and sheep. When hunted it makes a determined
resistance, and emits a scent so strong as even to sicken
the dogs, who nevertheless are exceedingly fond of the sport,
and cannot be got to pursue any other game while the stench
of the zibeth is in their nostrils. In confinement, it becomes
comparatively tame, and yields civet in considerable quantity.
In preparing this for the market it is usually spread out on the
leaves of the pepper plant in order to free it from the hairs that
have become detached from the pouch. On the Malabar coast
this species is replaced by <i>V. civettina</i>. The small Indian civet
or rasse (<i>Viverricula malaccensis</i>) ranges from Madagascar
through India to China, the Malay Peninsula, and the islands
of the Archipelago. It is almost 3 ft. long including the tail,
and prettily marked with dark longitudinal stripes, and spots
which have a distinctly linear arrangement. The perfume,
which is extracted in the same way as in the two preceding
species, is highly valued and much used by the Javanese. Although
this animal is said to be an expert climber it usually
inhabits holes in the ground. It is frequently kept in captivity
in the East, and becomes tame. Fossil remains of extinct
civets are found in the Miocene strata of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CIVIDALE DEL FRIULI<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (anc. <i>Forum Iulii</i>), a town of Venetia,
Italy, in the province of Udine, 10 m. E. by N. by rail from the
town of Udine; 453 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1001) town, 4143;
commune, 9061. It is situated on the river Natisone, which
forms a picturesque ravine here. It contains some interesting
relics of the art of the 8th century. The cathedral of the 15th
century contains an octagonal marble canopy with sculptures
in relief, with a font below it belonging to the 8th century, but
altered later. The high altar has a fine silver altar front of 1185.
The museum contains various Roman and Lombard antiquities,
and valuable MSS. and works of art in gold, silver and ivory
formerly belonging to the cathedral chapter. The small church
of S. Maria in Valle belongs to the 8th century, and contains
fine decorations in stucco which probably belong to the 11th
or 12th century. The fine 15th-century Ponte del Diavolo
leads to the church of S. Martino, which contains an altar of
the 8th century with reliefs executed by order of the Lombard
king Ratchis. At Cividale were born Paulus Diaconus, the
historian of the Lombards in the time of Charlemagne, and the
actress Adelaide Ristori (1822-1906).</p>

<p>The Roman town (a <i>municipium</i>) of Forum Iulii was founded
either by Julius Caesar or by Augustus, no doubt at the same
time as the construction of the Via Iulia Augusta, which passed
through Utina (Udine) on its way north. After the decay of
Aquileia and Iulium Carnicum (Zuglio) it became the chief town
of the district of Friuli and gave its name to it. The patriarchs
of Aquileia resided here from 773 to 1031, when they returned
to Aquileia, and finally in 1238 removed to Udine. This last
change of residence was the origin of the antagonism between
Cividale and Udine, which was only terminated by their surrender
to Venice in 1419 and 1420 respectively.</p>

Batavian revolt against Rome (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 69-70). He was twice
imprisoned on a charge of rebellion, and narrowly escaped
execution. During the disturbances that followed the death
of Nero, he took up arms under pretence of siding with Vespasian
and induced the inhabitants of his native country to rebel.
The Batavians, who had rendered valuable aid under the early
emperors, had been well treated in order to attach them to the
cause of Rome. They were exempt from tribute, but were
obliged to supply a large number of men for the army, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
burden of conscription and the oppressions of provincial governors
were important incentives to revolt. The Batavians were
immediately joined by several neighbouring German tribes,
the most important of whom were the Frisians. The Roman
garrisons near the Rhine were driven out, and twenty-four ships
captured. Two legions under Mummius Lupercus were defeated
at Castra Vetera (near the modern Xanten) and surrounded.
Eight cohorts of Batavian veterans joined their countrymen,
and the troops sent by Vespasian to the relief of Vetera threw in
their lot with them. The result of these accessions to the forces of
Civilis was a rising in Gaul. Hordeonius Flaccus was murdered
by his troops (70), and the whole of the Roman forces were induced
by two commanders of the Gallic auxiliaries&mdash;Julius
Classicus and Julius Tutor&mdash;to revolt from Rome and join
Civilis. The whole of Gaul thus practically declared itself
independent, and the foundation of a new kingdom of Gaul
was contemplated. The prophetess Velleda predicted the complete
success of Civilis and the fall of the Roman Empire. But
disputes broke out amongst the different tribes and rendered
co-operation impossible; Vespasian, having successfully ended
the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on
his refusal resolved to take strong measures for the suppression
of the revolt. The arrival of Petillius Cerialis with a strong force
awed the Gauls and mutinous troops into submission; Civilis was
defeated at Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Trèves) and Vetera,
and forced to withdraw to the island of the Batavians. He
finally came to an agreement with Cerialis whereby his countrymen
obtained certain advantages, and resumed amicable
relations with Rome. From this time Civilis disappears from
history.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIVILIZATION<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span>. The word &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; is an obvious
derivative of the Lat. <i>civis</i>, a citizen, and <i>civilis</i>, pertaining to
a citizen. Etymologically speaking, then, it would be putting no
undue strain upon the word to interpret it as having to do with
the entire period of human progress since mankind attained
sufficient intelligence and social unity to develop a system of
government. But in practice &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; is usually interpreted
in a somewhat narrower sense, as having application
solely to the most recent and comparatively brief period of time
that has elapsed since the most highly developed races of men
have used systems of writing. This restricted usage is probably
explicable, in part at least, by the fact that the word, though
distinctly modern in origin, is nevertheless older than the interpretation
of social evolution that now finds universal acceptance.
Only very recently has it come to be understood that primitive
societies vastly antedating the historical period had attained
relatively high stages of development and fixity, socially and
politically. Now that this is understood, however, nothing but
an arbitrary and highly inconvenient restriction of meanings
can prevent us from speaking of the citizens of these early
societies as having attained certain stages of civilization. It will
be convenient, then, in outlining the successive stages of human
progress here, to include under the comprehensive term &ldquo;civilization&rdquo;
those long earlier periods of &ldquo;savagery&rdquo; and &ldquo;barbarism&rdquo;
as well as the more recent period of higher development to which
the word &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; is sometimes restricted.</p>

<p>Adequate proof that civilization as we now know it is the
result of a long, slow process of evolution was put forward not
long after the middle of the 19th century by the
students of palaeontology and of prehistoric archaeology.
<span class="sidenote">Savagery and barbarism.</span>
A recognition of the fact that primitive man
used implements of chipped flint, of polished stone,
and of the softer metals for successive ages, before he attained
a degree of technical skill and knowledge that would enable
him to smelt iron, led the Danish archaeologists to classify the
stages of human progress under these captions: the Rough
Stone Age; the Age of Polished Stone; the Age of Bronze;
and the Age of Iron. These terms acquired almost universal
recognition, and they retain popularity as affording a very broad
outline of the story of human progress. It is obviously desirable,
however, to fill in the outlines of the story more in detail.
To some extent it has been possible to do so, largely through
the efforts of ethnologists who have studied the social conditions
of existing races of savages. A recognition of the principle
that, broadly speaking, progress has everywhere been achieved
along the same lines and through the same sequence of changes,
makes it possible to interpret the past history of the civilized
races of to-day in the light of the present-day conditions of other
races that are still existing under social and political conditions
of a more primitive type. Such races as the Maoris and the
American Indians have furnished invaluable information to
the student of social evolution; and the knowledge thus gained
has been extended and fortified by the ever-expanding researches
of the palaeontologist and archaeologist.</p>

<p>Thus it has become possible to present with some confidence
a picture showing the successive stages of human development
during the long dark period when our prehistoric ancestor was
advancing along the toilsome and tortuous but on the whole
always uprising path from lowest savagery to the stage of relative
enlightenment at which we find him at the so-called &ldquo;dawnings
of history.&rdquo; That he was for long ages a savage before he
attained sufficient culture to be termed, in modern phraseology,
a barbarian, admits of no question. Equally little in doubt is it
that other long ages of barbarism preceded the final ascent
to civilization. The precise period of time covered by these
successive &ldquo;Ages&rdquo; is of course only conjectural; but something
like one hundred thousand years may perhaps be taken as a
safe minimal estimate. At the beginning of this long period,
the most advanced race of men must be thought of as a promiscuous
company of pre-troglodytic mammals, at least partially
arboreal in habit, living on uncooked fruits and vegetables, and
possessed of no arts and crafts whatever&mdash;nor even of the knowledge
of the rudest implement. At the end of the period, there
emerges into the more or less clear light of history a large-brained
being, living in houses of elaborate construction, supplying
himself with divers luxuries through the aid of a multitude
of elaborate handicrafts, associated with his fellows under the
sway of highly organized governments, and satisfying aesthetic
needs through the practice of pictorial and literary arts of a
high order. How was this amazing transformation brought
about?</p>

<p>If an answer can be found to that query, we shall have a clue
to all human progress, not only during the prehistoric but also
during the historic periods; for we may well believe
that recent progress has not departed from the scheme
<span class="sidenote">Crucial developments.</span>
of development impressed on humanity during that
long apprenticeship. Ethnologists believe that an
answer can be found. They believe that the metamorphosis from
beast-like savage to cultured civilian may be proximally explained
(certain potentialities and attributes of the species being
taken for granted) as the result of accumulated changes that
found their initial impulses in a half-dozen or so of practical
inventions. Stated thus, the explanation seems absurdly simple.
Confessedly it supplies only a proximal, not a final, analysis
of the forces impelling mankind along the pathway of progress.
But it has the merit of tangibility; it presents certain highly
important facts of human history vividly: and it furnishes a
definite and fairly satisfactory basis for marking successive stages
of incipient civilization.</p>

<p>In outlining the story of primitive man&rsquo;s advancement, upon
such a basis, we may follow the scheme of one of the most
philosophical of ethnologists, Lewis H. Morgan, who made a
provisional analysis of the prehistoric period that still remains
among the most satisfactory attempts in this direction. Morgan
divides the entire epoch of man&rsquo;s progress from bestiality to
civilization into six successive periods, which he names respectively
the Older, Middle and Later periods of Savagery, and
the Older, Middle and Later periods of Barbarism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span></p>

<p>The first of these periods, when mankind was in the lower
status of savagery, comprises the epoch when articulate speech
was being developed. Our ancestors of this epoch
<span class="sidenote">Speech.</span>
inhabited a necessarily restricted tropical territory,
and subsisted upon raw nuts and fruits. They had no knowledge
of the uses of fire. All existing races of men had advanced
beyond this condition before the opening of the historical period.</p>

<p>The Middle Period of Savagery began with a knowledge of the
uses of fire. This wonderful discovery enabled the developing
race to extend its habitat almost indefinitely, and to
include flesh, and in particular fish, in its regular
<span class="sidenote">Fire.</span>
dietary. Man could now leave the forests, and wander along
the shores and rivers, migrating to climates less enervating
than those to which he had previously been confined. Doubtless
he became an expert fisher, but he was as yet poorly equipped
for hunting, being provided, probably, with no weapon more
formidable than a crude hatchet and a roughly fashioned spear.
The primitive races of Australia and Polynesia had not advanced
beyond this middle status of savagery when they were discovered
a few generations ago. It is obvious, then, that in dealing with
the further progress of nascent civilization we have to do with
certain favoured portions of the race, which sought out new
territories and developed new capacities while many tribes of
their quondam peers remained static and hence by comparison
seemed to retrograde.</p>

<p>The next great epochal discovery, in virtue of which a portion
of the race advanced to the Upper Status of Savagery, was that
of the bow and arrow,&mdash;a truly wonderful implement.
The possessor of this device could bring down the
<span class="sidenote">Bow and arrow.</span>
fleetest animal and could defend himself against the
most predatory. He could provide himself not only with food
but with materials for clothing and for tent-making, and thus
could migrate at will back from the seas and large rivers, and
far into inhospitable but invigorating temperate and sub-Arctic
regions. The meat diet, now for the first time freely available,
probably contributed, along with the stimulating climate, to
increase the physical vigour and courage of this highest savage,
thus urging him along the paths of progress. Nevertheless
many tribes came thus far and no further, as witness the Athapascans
of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Territory and the Indians of the
valley of the Columbia.</p>

<p>We now come to the marvellous discovery that enabled our
ancestor to make such advances upon the social conditions of
his forbears as to entitle him, in the estimate of his
remote descendants, to be considered as putting
<span class="sidenote">Pottery.</span>
savagery behind him and as entering upon the Lower Status of
Barbarism. The discovery in question had to do with the
practice of the art of making pottery (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span>). Hitherto
man had been possessed of no permanent utensils that could
withstand the action of fire. He could not readily boil water
except by some such cumbersome method as the dropping of
heated stones into a wooden or skin receptacle. The effect
upon his dietary of having at hand earthen vessels in which
meat and herbs could be boiled over a fire must have been
momentous. Various meats and many vegetables become
highly palatable when boiled that are almost or quite inedible
when merely roasted before a fire. Bones, sinews and even
hides may be made to give up a modicum of nutriment in this
way; and doubtless barbaric man, before whom starvation
always loomed threateningly, found the crude pot an almost
perennial refuge. And of course its use as a cooking utensil
was only one of many ways in which the newly discovered
mechanism exerted a civilizing influence.</p>

<p>The next great progressive movement, which carried man
into the Middle Status of Barbarism, is associated with the
domestication of animals in the Eastern hemisphere,
and with the use of irrigation in cultivating the soil and
<span class="sidenote">Domestic animals.</span>
of adobe bricks and stone in architecture in the Western
hemisphere. The dog was probably the first animal to be
domesticated, but the sheep, the ox, the camel and the horse
were doubtless added in relatively rapid succession, so soon
as the idea that captive animals could be of service had been
clearly conceived. Man now became a herdsman, no longer
dependent for food upon the precarious chase of wild animals.
Milk, procurable at all seasons, made a highly important addition
to his dietary. With the aid of camel and horse he could traverse
wide areas hitherto impassable, and come in contact with
distant peoples. Thus commerce came to play an extended
rôle in the dissemination of both commodities and ideas. In
particular the nascent civilization of the Mediterranean region
fell heir to numerous products of farther Asia,&mdash;gums, spices,
oils, and most important of all, the cereals. The cultivation of
the latter gave the finishing touch to a comprehensive and
varied diet, while emphasizing the value of a fixed abode. For
the first time it now became possible for large numbers of people
to form localized communities. A natural consequence was
the elaboration of political systems, which, however, proceeded
along lines already suggested by the experience of earlier epochs.
All this tended to establish and emphasize the idea of nationality,
based primarily on blood-relationship; and at the same
time to develop within the community itself the idea of property,&mdash;that
is to say, of valuable or desirable commodities which have
come into the possession of an individual through his enterprise
or labour, and which should therefore be subject to his voluntary
disposal. At an earlier stage of development, all property had
been of communal, not of individual, ownership. It appears, then,
that our mid-period barbarian had attained&mdash;if the verbal contradiction
be permitted&mdash;a relatively high stage of civilization.</p>

<p>There remained, however, one master craft of which he had
no conception. This was the art of smelting iron. When,
ultimately, his descendants learned the wonderful
secrets of that art, they rose in consequence to the
<span class="sidenote">Iron.</span>
Upper Status of Barbarism. This culminating practical invention,
it will be observed, is the first of the great discoveries
with which we have to do that was not primarily concerned
with the question of man&rsquo;s food supply. Iron, to be sure, has
abundant uses in the same connexion, but its most direct and
obvious utilities have to do with weapons of war and with
implements calculated to promote such arts of peace as house-building,
road-making and the construction of vehicles. Wood
and stone could now be fashioned as never before. Houses
could be built and cities walled with unexampled facility; to
say nothing of the making of a multitude of minor implements
and utensils hitherto quite unknown, or at best rare and costly.
Nor must we overlook the aesthetic influence of edged implements,
with which wood and stone could readily be sculptured
when placed in the hands of a race that had long been accustomed
to scratch the semblance of living forms on bone or ivory and to
fashion crude images of clay. In a word, man, the &ldquo;tool-making
animal,&rdquo; was now for the first time provided with tools worthy
of his wonderful hands and yet more wonderful brain.</p>

<p>Thus through the application of one revolutionary invention
after another, the most advanced races of men had arrived,
after long ages of effort, at a relatively high stage of development.
A very wide range of experiences had enabled man to evolve
a complex body politic, based on a fairly secure social basis,
and his brain had correspondingly developed into a relatively
efficient and stable organ of thought. But as yet he had devised
no means of communicating freely with other people at a distance
except through the medium of verbal messages; nor had he
any method by which he could transmit his experiences to
posterity more securely than by fugitive and fallible oral traditions.
A vague symbolization of his achievements was preserved
from generation to generation in myth-tale and epic, but he
knew not how to make permanent record of his history. Until
he could devise a means to make such record, he must remain,
in the estimate of his descendants, a barbarian, though he might
be admitted to have become a highly organized and even in a
broad sense a cultured being.</p>

<p>At length, however, this last barrier was broken. Some race
or races devised a method of symbolizing events and ultimately
of making even abstruse ideas tangible by means of
graphic signs. In other words, a system of writing
<span class="sidenote"><b>Writing.</b></span>
was developed. Man thus achieved a virtual conquest over time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
as he had earlier conquered space. He could now transmit
the record of his deeds and his thoughts to remote posterity.
Thus he stood at the portals of what later generations would term
secure history. He had graduated out of barbarism, and become
in the narrower sense of the word a civilized being. Henceforth,
his knowledge, his poetical dreamings, his moral aspirations
might be recorded in such form as to be read not merely by his
contemporaries but by successive generations of remote posterity.
The inspiring character of such a message is obvious. The validity
of making this great culminating intellectual achievement the
test of &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; existence need not be denied. But we should
ill comprehend the character of the message which the earlier
generations of civilized beings transmit to us from the period
which we term the &ldquo;dawning of history&rdquo; did we not bear
constantly in mind the long series of progressive stages of
&ldquo;savagery&rdquo; and &ldquo;barbarism&rdquo; that of necessity preceded the
final stage of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; proper. The achievements of
those earlier stages afforded the secure foundation for the progress
of the future. A multitude of minor arts, in addition
to the important ones just outlined, had been developed; and
for a long time civilized man was to make no other epochal
addition to the list of accomplishments that came to him as a
heritage from his barbaric progenitor. Indeed, even to this
day the list of such additions is not a long one, nor, judged in
the relative scale, so important as might at first thought be
supposed. Whoever considers the subject carefully must admit
the force of Morgan&rsquo;s suggestion that man&rsquo;s achievements as a
barbarian, considered in their relation to the sum of human
progress, &ldquo;transcend, in relative importance, all his subsequent
works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without insisting on this comparison, however, let us ask
what discoveries and inventions man has made within the
historical period that may fairly be ranked with the half-dozen
great epochal achievements that have been put forward as
furnishing the keys to all the progress of the prehistoric periods.
In other words, let us sketch the history of progress during the ten
thousand years or so that have elapsed since man learned the
art of writing, adapting our sketch to the same scale which we
have already applied to the unnumbered millenniums of the prehistoric
period. The view of world-history thus outlined will be
a very different one from what might be expected by the student
of national history; but it will present the essentials of the
progress of civilization in a suggestive light.</p>

<p>Without pretending to fix an exact date,&mdash;which the historical
records do not at present permit,&mdash;we may assume that the
most advanced race of men elaborated a system of
writing not less than six thousand years before the
<span class="sidenote">Civilization proper.</span>
beginning of the Christian era. Holding to the
terminology already suggested for the earlier periods,
we may speak of man&rsquo;s position during the ensuing generations
as that of the First or Lowest Status of civilization. If we review
the history of this period we shall find that it extends unbroken
over a stretch of at least four or five thousand years. During
the early part of this period such localized civilizations as those
of the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Babylonians and the Hittites
rose, grew strong and passed beyond their meridian. This suggests
that we must now admit the word &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; to yet
another definition, within its larger meaning: we must speak
of &ldquo;<i>a</i> civilization,&rdquo; as that of Egypt, of Babylonia, of Assyria,
and we must understand thereby a localized phase of society bearing
the same relation to civilization as a whole that a wave bears
to the ocean or a tree to the forest. Such other localized civilizations
as those of Phoenicia, Carthage, Greece, Rome, Byzantium,
the Sassanids, in due course waxed and waned, leaving a tremendous
imprint on national history, but creating only minor
and transitory ripples in the great ocean of civilization. Progress
in the elaboration of the details of earlier methods and inventions
took place as a matter of course. Some nation, probably the
Phoenicians, gave a new impetus to the art of writing by developing
a phonetic alphabet; but this achievement, remarkable as
it was in itself, added nothing fundamental to human capacity.
Literatures had previously flourished through the use of hieroglyphic
and syllabic symbols; and the Babylonian syllabics
continued in vogue throughout western Asia for a long time
after the Phoenician alphabet had demonstrated its intrinsic
superiority.</p>

<p>Similarly the art of Egyptian and Assyrian and Greek was but
the elaboration and perfection of methods that barbaric man
had practised away back in the days when he was a cave-dweller.
The weapons of warfare of Greek and Roman were the spear
and the bow and arrow that their ancestors had used in the period
of savagery, aided by sword and helmet dating from the upper
period of barbarism. Greek and Roman government at their
best were founded upon the system of <i>gentes</i> that barbaric man
had profoundly studied,&mdash;as witness, for example, the federal
system of the barbaric Iroquois Indians existing in America
before the coming of Columbus. And if the Greeks had better
literature, the Romans better roads and larger cities, than their
predecessors, these are but matters of detailed development,
the like of which had marked the progress of the more important
arts and the introduction of less important ancillary ones in
each antecedent period. The axe of steel is no new implement,
but a mere perfecting of the axe of chipped flint. The <i>Iliad</i>
represents the perfecting of an art that unnumbered generations
of barbarians practised before their camp-fires.</p>

<p>Thus for six or seven thousand years after man achieved
civilization there was rhythmic progress in many lines, but there
came no great epochal invention to usher in a new
ethnic period. Then, towards the close of what
<span class="sidenote">Great inventions of the middle ages.</span>
historians of to-day are accustomed to call the middle
ages, there appeared in rapid sequence three or four
inventions and a great scientific discovery that, taken
together, were destined to change the entire aspect of European
civilization. The inventions were gunpowder, the mariner&rsquo;s
compass, paper and the printing-press, three of which appear to
have been brought into Europe by the Moors, whether or not
they originated in the remote East. The scientific discovery
which must be coupled with these inventions was the Copernican
demonstration that the sun and not the earth is the centre of our
planetary system. The generations of men that found themselves
(1) confronted with the revolutionary conception of the
universe given by the Copernican theory; (2) supplied with the
new means of warfare provided by gunpowder; (3) equipped
with an undreamed-of guide across the waters of the earth; and
(4) enabled to promulgate knowledge with unexampled speed and
cheapness through the aid of paper and printing-press&mdash;such
generations of men might well be said to have entered upon a new
ethnic period. The transition in their mode of thought and in
their methods of practical life was as great as can be supposed
to have resulted, in an early generation, from the introduction
of iron, or in a yet earlier from the invention of the bow and
arrow. So the Europeans of about the 15th century of the
Christian era may be said to have entered upon the Second or
Middle Status of civilization.</p>

<p>The new period was destined to be a brief one. It had compassed
only about four hundred years when, towards the close
of the 18th century, James Watt gave to the world
the perfected steam-engine. Almost contemporaneously
<span class="sidenote">Steam machinery.</span>
Arkwright and Hargreaves developed revolutionary
processes of spinning and weaving by machinery.
Meantime James Hutton and William Smith and their successors
on the one hand, and Erasmus Darwin, François Lamarck, and
(a half-century later) Charles Darwin on the other, turned men&rsquo;s
ideas topsy-turvy by demonstrating that the world as the
abiding-place of animals and man is enormously old, and that
man himself instead of deteriorating from a single perfect pair
six thousand years removed, has ascended from bestiality through
a slow process of evolution extending over hundreds of centuries.
The revolution in practical life and in the mental life of our race
that followed these inventions and this new presentation of
truth probably exceeded in suddenness and in its far-reaching
effects the metamorphosis effected at any previous transition
from one ethnic period to another. The men of the 19th century,
living now in the period that may be termed the Upper Status
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
of civilization, saw such changes effected in the practical affairs
of their everyday lives as had not been wrought before during the
entire historical period. Their fathers had travelled in vehicles
drawn by horses, quite as their remoter ancestors had done since
the time of higher barbarism. It may be doubted whether
there existed in the world in the year 1800 a postal service that
could compare in speed and efficiency with the express service
of the Romans of the time of Caesar; far less was there a telegraph
service that could compare with that of the ancient
Persians. Nor was there a ship sailing the seas that a Phoenician
trireme might not have overhauled. But now within the
lifetime of a single man the world was covered with a network
of steel rails on which locomotives drew gigantic vehicles, laden
with passengers at an hourly speed almost equalling Caesar&rsquo;s
best journey of a day; over the land and under the seas were
stretched wires along which messages coursed from continent
to continent literally with the speed of lightning; and the waters
of the earth were made to teem with gigantic craft propelled
without sail or oar at a speed which the Phoenician captain of
three thousand years ago and the English captain of the 18th
century would alike have held incredible.</p>

<p>There is no need to give further details here of the industrial
revolutions that have been achieved in this newest period of
civilization, since in their broader outlines at least
they are familiar to every one. Nor need we dwell
<span class="sidenote">Social and political organization.</span>
upon the revolution in thought whereby man has for
the first time been given a clear inkling as to his
origin and destiny. It suffices to point out that such periods
of fermentation of ideas as this suggests have probably always
been concomitant with those outbursts of creative genius that
gave the world the practical inventions upon which human
progress has been conditioned. The same attitude of receptivity
to new ideas is pre-requisite to one form of discovery as to the
other. Nor, it may be added, can either form of idea become
effective for the progress of civilization except in proportion as a
large body of any given generation are prepared to receive it.
Doubtless here and there a dreamer played with fire, in a literal
sense, for generations before the utility of fire as a practical aid
to human progress came to be recognized in practice. And&mdash;to
seek an illustration at the other end of the scale&mdash;we know
that the advanced thinkers of Greece and Rome believed in the
antiquity of the earth and in the evolution of man two thousand
years before the coming of Darwin. We have but partly solved
the mysteries of the progress of civilization, then, when we have
pointed out that each tangible stage of progress owed its initiative
to a new invention or discovery of science. To go to the root
of the matter we must needs explain how it came about that a
given generation of men was in mental mood to receive the new
invention or discovery.</p>

<p>The pursuit of this question would carry us farther into the
realm of communal and racial psychology&mdash;to say nothing of
the realm of conjecture&mdash;than comports with the purpose of
this article. It must suffice to point out that alertness of mind&mdash;that
all mentality&mdash;is, in the last analysis, a reaction to the
influences of the environment. It follows that man may subject
himself to new influences and thus give his mind a new stimulus
by changing his habitat. A fundamental secret of progress is
revealed in this fact. Man probably never would have evolved
from savagery had he remained in the Tropics where he doubtless
originated. But successive scientific inventions enabled him,
as has been suggested, to migrate to distant latitudes, and thus
more or less involuntarily to become the recipient of new creative
and progressive impulses. After migrations in many directions
had resulted in the development of divers races, each with
certain capacities and acquirements due to its unique environment,
there was opportunity for the application of the principle
of environmental stimulus in an indirect way, through the
mingling and physical intermixture of one race with another.
Each of the great localized civilizations of antiquity appears
to have owed its prominence in part at least&mdash;perhaps very
largely&mdash;to such intermingling of two or more races. Each
of these civilizations began to decay so soon as the nation had
remained for a considerable number of generations in its localized
environment, and had practically ceased to receive accretions
from distant races at approximately the same stage of development.
There is a suggestive lesson for present-day civilization
in that thought-compelling fact. Further evidence of the
application of the principle of environmental stimulus, operating
through changed habitat and racial intermixture, is furnished
by the virility of the colonial peoples of our own day. The
receptiveness to new ideas and the rapidity of material progress
of Americans, South Africans and Australians are proverbial.
No one doubts, probably, that one or another of these countries
will give a new stimulus to the progress of civilization, through
the promulgation of some great epochal discovery, in the not
distant future. Again, the value of racial intermingling is
shown yet nearer home in the long-continued vitality of the
British nation, which is explicable, in some measure at least, by
the fact that the Celtic element held aloof from the Anglo-Saxon
element century after century sufficiently to maintain racial
integrity, yet mingled sufficiently to give and receive the fresh
stimulus of &ldquo;new blood.&rdquo; It is interesting in this connexion
to examine the map of Great Britain with reference to the
birthplaces of the men named above as being the originators
of the inventions and discoveries that made the close of the 18th
century memorable as ushering in a new ethnic era. It may be
added that these names suggest yet another element in the
causation of progress: the fact, namely, that, however necessary
racial receptivity may be to the dynamitic upheaval of a new
ethnic era, it is after all <i>individual</i> genius that applies its
detonating spark.</p>

<p>Without further elaboration of this aspect of the subject
it may be useful to recapitulate the analysis of the evolution
of civilization above given, prior to characterizing
it from another standpoint. It appears that the entire
<span class="sidenote">Nine periods of progress.</span>
period of human progress up to the present may be
divided into nine periods which, if of necessity more
or less arbitrary, yet are not without certain warrant of logic.
They may be defined as follows: (1) The Lower Period of
Savagery, terminating with the discovery and application of the
uses of fire. (2) The Middle Period of Savagery, terminating
with the invention of the bow and arrow. (3) The Upper Period
of Savagery, terminating with the invention of pottery. (4) The
Lower Period of Barbarism, terminating with the domestication
of animals. (5) The Middle Period of Barbarism, terminating
with the discovery of the process of smelting iron ore. (6) The
Upper Period of Barbarism, terminating with the development
of a system of writing meeting the requirements of literary
composition. (7) The First Period of Civilization (proper)
terminating with the introduction of gunpowder. (8) The Second
Period of Civilization, terminating with the invention of a
practical steam-engine. (9) The Upper Period of Civilization,
which is still in progress, but which, as will be suggested in a
moment, is probably nearing its termination.</p>

<p>It requires but a glance at the characteristics of these successive
epochs to show the ever-increasing complexity of the inventions
that delimit them and of the conditions of life that they
connote. Were we to attempt to characterize in a few phrases the
entire story of achievement thus outlined, we might say that
during the three stages of Savagery man was attempting to make
himself master of the geographical climates. His unconscious
ideal was, to gain a foothold and the means of subsistence in
every zone. During the three periods of Barbarism the ideal
of conquest was extended to the beasts of the field, the vegetable
world, and the mineral contents of the earth&rsquo;s crust. During the
three periods of Civilization proper the ideal of conquest has
become still more intellectual and subtle, being now extended
to such abstractions as an analysis of speech-sounds, and to such
intangibles as expanding gases and still more elusive electric
currents: in other words, to the forces of nature, no less than
to tangible substances. Hand in hand with this growing
complexity of man&rsquo;s relations with the external world has
gone a like increase of complexity in the social and political
organizations that characterize man&rsquo;s relations with his fellowmen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
In savagery the family expanded into the tribe; in
barbarism the tribe developed into the nation. The epoch of
civilization proper is aptly named, because it has been a time in
which citizenship, in the narrower national significance, has
probably been developed to its apogee. Throughout this period,
in every land, the highest virtue has been considered to be
patriotism,&mdash;by which must be understood an instinctive
willingness on the part of every individual to defend even with
his life the interests of the nation into which he chances to be
born, regardless of whether the national cause in which he struggles
be in any given case good or bad, right or wrong. The communal
judgment of this epoch pronounces any man a traitor who will
not uphold his own nation even in a wrong cause&mdash;and the word
&ldquo;traitor&rdquo; marks the utmost brand of ignominy.</p>

<p>But while the idea of nationality has thus been accentuated,
there has been a never-ending struggle within the bounds of the
nation itself to adjust the relations of one citizen to
another. The ideas that might makes right, that the
<span class="sidenote">Nationality and cosmopolitanism.</span>
strong man must dominate the weak, that leadership
in the community properly belongs to the man who is
physically most competent to lead&mdash;these ideas were
a perfectly natural, and indeed an inevitable, outgrowth of the
conditions under which man fought his way up through savagery
and barbarism. Man in the first period of civilization inherited
these ideas, along with the conditions of society that were their
concomitants. So throughout the periods when the oriental
civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia and Assyria and Persia
were dominant, a despotic form of government was accepted
as the natural order of things. It does not appear that any other
form was even considered as a practicality. A despot might
indeed be overthrown, but only to make way for the coronation
of another despot. A little later the Greeks and Romans modified
the conception of a heaven-sent individual monarch; but they
went no further than to substitute a heaven-favoured community,
with specially favoured groups (<i>Patricii</i>) within the community.
With this, national egoism reached its climax; for each people
regarded its own citizens as the only exemplars of civilization,
openly branding all the rest of the world as &ldquo;barbarians,&rdquo; fit
subjects for the exaction of tribute or for the imposition of the
bonds of actual slavery. During the middle ages there was a
reaction towards individualism as opposed to nationalism:
but the entire system of feudalism, with its clearly recognized
conditions of over-lordship and of vassaldom, gave expression,
no less clearly than oriental despotism and classical &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;
had done, to the idea of individual inequality; of
divergence of moral and legal status based on natural inheritance.
Thus this idea, a reminiscence of barbarism, maintained its
dominance throughout the first period of civilization.</p>

<p>But gunpowder, marking the transition to the second period
of civilization, came as a great levelling influence. With its aid
the weakest peasant might prove more than a match for the most
powerful knight. Before its assaults the castle of the lord ceased
to be an impregnable fortress. And while gunpowder thus
levelled down the power of the mighty, the printing-press levelled
up the intelligence, and hence the power and influence of the
lowly. Meantime the mariner&rsquo;s compass opened up new territories
beyond the seas, and in due course men of lowly origin were
seen to attain to wealth and power through commercial pursuits,
thus tending to break in upon the established social order. In
the colonial territories themselves all men were subjected more
or less to the same perils and dependent upon their own efforts.
Success and prominence in the community came not as a birthright,
but as the result of demonstrated fitness. The great
lesson that the interests of all members of a community are,
in the last analysis, mutual could be more clearly distinguished
in these small colonies than in larger and older bodies politic.
Through various channels, therefore, in the successive generations
of this middle period of civilization, the idea gained ground
that intelligence and moral worth, rather than physical prowess,
should be the test of greatness; that it is incumbent on the strong
in the interests of the body politic to protect the weak; and that,
in the long run, the best interests of the community are conserved
if all its members, without exception, are given moral equality
before the law. This idea of equal rights and privileges for all
members of the community&mdash;for each individual &ldquo;the greatest
amount of liberty consistent with a like liberty of every other
individual&rdquo;&mdash;first found expression as a philosophical doctrine
towards the close of the 18th century; at which time also tentative
efforts were made to put it into practice. It may be said
therefore to represent the culminating sociological doctrine of
the middle period of civilization,&mdash;the ideal towards which all
the influences of the period had tended to impel the race.</p>

<p>It will be observed, however, that this ideal of individual
equality within the body politic in no direct wise influences the
status of the body politic itself as the centre of a localized
civilization that may be regarded as in a sense antagonistic to
all other similarly localized civilizations. If there were any such
influence, it would rather operate in the direction of accentuating
the patriotism of the member of a democratical community, as
against that of the subject of a despot, through the sense of
personal responsibility developed in the former. The developments
of the middle period of civilization cannot be considered,
therefore, to have tended to decrease the spirit of nationality,
with its concomitant penalty of what is sometimes called provincialism.
The history of this entire period, as commonly
presented, is largely made up of the records of international
rivalries and jealousies, perennially culminating in bitterly
contested wars. It was only towards the close of the epoch that
the desirability of free commercial intercourse among nations
began to find expression as a philosophical creed through the
efforts of Quesnay and his followers; and the doctrine that both
parties to an international commercial transaction are gainers
thereby found its first clear expression in the year 1776 in the
pages of Condillac and of Adam Smith.</p>

<p>But the discoveries that ushered in the third period of civilization
were destined to work powerfully from the outset for the
breaking down of international barriers, though, of course,
their effects would not be at once manifest. Thus the substitution
of steam power for water power, besides giving a tremendous
impetus to manufacturing in general, mapped out new industrial
centres in regions that nature had supplied with coal but not
always with other raw materials. To note a single result,
England became the manufacturing centre of the world, drawing
its raw materials from every corner of the globe; but in so
doing it ceased to be self-supporting as regards the production
of food-supplies. While growing in national wealth, as a result
of the new inventions, England has therefore lost immeasurably
in national self-sufficiency and independence; having become
in large measure dependent upon other countries both for the
raw materials without which her industries must perish and for
the foods to maintain the very life of her people.</p>

<p>What is true of England in this regard is of course true in
greater or less measure of all other countries. Everywhere,
thanks to the new mechanisms that increase industrial efficiency,
there has been an increasing tendency to specialization; and
since the manufacturer must often find his raw materials in one
part of the world and his markets in another, this implies
an ever-increasing intercommunication and interdependence
between the nations. This spirit is obviously fostered by the
new means of transportation by locomotive and steamship, and
by the electric communication that enables the Londoner, for
example, to transact business in New York or in Tokio with
scarcely an hour&rsquo;s delay; and that puts every one in touch at
to-day&rsquo;s breakfast table with the happenings of the entire world.
Thanks to the new mechanisms, national isolation is no longer
possible; globe-trotting has become a habit with thousands of
individuals of many nations; and Orient and Occident, representing
civilizations that for thousands of years were almost
absolutely severed and mutually oblivious of each other, have
been brought again into close touch for mutual education and
betterment. The Western mind has learned with amazement
that the aforetime <i>Terra Incognita</i> of the far East has nurtured
a gigantic civilization having ideals in many ways far different
from our own. The Eastern mind has proved itself capable, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
self-defence, of absorbing the essential practicalities of Western
civilization within a single generation. Some of the most
important problems of world-civilization of the immediate
future hinge upon the mutual relations of these two long-severed
communities, branched at some early stage of progress to
opposite hemispheres of the globe, but now brought by the new
mechanisms into daily and even hourly communication.</p>

<p>While the new conditions of the industrial world have thus
tended to develop a new national outlook, there has come about,
as a result of the scientific discoveries already referred
to, a no less significant broadening of the mental and
<span class="sidenote">Modern humanism.</span>
spiritual horizons. Here also the trend is away from
the narrowly egoistic and towards the cosmopolitan view.
About the middle of the 19th century Dr Pritchard declared
that many people debated whether it might not be permissible
for the Australian settlers to shoot the natives as food for their
dogs; some of the disputants arguing that savages were without
the pale of human brotherhood. To-day the thesis that all
mankind are one brotherhood needs no defence. The most
primitive of existing aborigines are regarded merely as brethren
who, through some defect or neglect of opportunity, have lagged
behind in the race. Similarly the defective and criminal classes
that make up so significant a part of the population of even
our highest present-day civilizations, are no longer regarded
with anger or contempt, as beings who are suffering just punishment
for wilful transgressions, but are considered as pitiful
victims of hereditary and environmental influences that they
could neither choose nor control. Insanity is no longer thought
of as demoniac possession, but as the most lamentable of diseases.</p>

<p>The changed attitude towards savage races and defective
classes affords tangible illustrations of a fundamental transformation
of point of view which doubtless represents the most important
result of the operation of new scientific knowledge in the
course of the 19th century. It is a transformation that is only
partially effected as yet, to be sure; but it is rapidly making
headway, and when fully achieved it will represent, probably,
the most radical metamorphosis of mental view that has taken
place in the entire course of the historical period. The essence
of the new view is this: to recognize the universality and the
invariability of natural law; stated otherwise, to understand
that the word &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; involves a contradiction of
terms and has in fact no meaning. Whoever has grasped the
full import of this truth is privileged to sweep mental horizons
wider by far than ever opened to the view of any thinker of an
earlier epoch. He is privileged to forecast, as the sure heritage
of the future, a civilization freed from the last ghost of superstition&mdash;an
Age of Reason in which mankind shall at last find
refuge from the hosts of occult and invisible powers, the fearsome
galaxies of deities and demons, which have haunted him thus
far at every stage of his long journey through savagery, barbarism
and civilization. Doubtless here and there a thinker, even in
the barbaric eras, may have realized that these ghosts that so
influenced the everyday lives of his fellows were but children
of the imagination. But the certainty that such is the case
could not have come with the force of demonstration even to
the most clear-sighted thinker until 19th-century science had
investigated with penetrating vision the realm of molecule
and atom; had revealed the awe-inspiring principle of the
conservation of energy; and had offered a comprehensible
explanation of the evolution of one form of life from another,
from monad to man, that did not presuppose the intervention of
powers more &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; than those that operate about
us everywhere to-day.</p>

<p>The stupendous import of these new truths could not, of
course, make itself evident to the generality of mankind in a
single generation, when opposed to superstitions of a thousand
generations&rsquo; standing. But the new knowledge has made its
way more expeditiously than could have been anticipated;
and its effects are seen on every side, even where its agency is
scarcely recognized. As a single illustration, we may note the
familiar observation that the entire complexion of orthodox
teaching of religion has been more altered in the past fifty
years than in two thousand years before. This of course is not
entirely due to the influence of physical and biological science;
no effect has a unique cause, in the complex sociological scheme.
Archaeology, comparative philology and textual criticism have
also contributed their share; and the comparative study of
religions has further tended to broaden the outlook and to make
for universality, as opposed to insularity, of view. It is coming
to be more and more widely recognized that all theologies are
but the reflex of the more or less faulty knowledge of the times
in which they originate, that the true and abiding purpose of
religion should be the practical betterment of humanity&mdash;the
advancement of civilization in the best sense of the word; and
that this end may perhaps be best subserved by different systems
of theology, adapted to the varied genius of different times and
divers races. Wherefore there is not the same enthusiastic
desire to-day that found expression a generation ago, to impose
upon the cultured millions of the East a religion that seems to
them alien to their manner of thought, unsuited to their needs
and less distinctly ethical in teaching than their own religions.</p>

<p>Such are but a few of the illustrations that might be cited from
many fields to suggest that the mind of our generation is becoming
receptive to a changed point of view that augurs the coming
of a new ethnic era. If one may be permitted to enter very
tentatively the field of prophecy, it seems not unlikely that the
great revolutionary invention which will close the third period
of civilization and usher in a new era is already being evolved.
It seems not over-hazardous to predict that the air-ship, in one
form or another, is destined to be the mechanism that will give
the new impetus to human civilization; that the next era will
have as one of its practical ideals the conquest of the air; and
that this conquest will become a factor in the final emergence of
humanity from the insularity of nationalism to the broad view
of cosmopolitanism, towards which, as we have seen, the tendencies
of the present era are verging. That the gap to be
covered is a vastly wide one no one need be reminded who recalls
that the civilized nations of Europe, together with America and
Japan, are at present accustomed to spend more than three
hundred million pounds each year merely that they may keep
armaments in readiness to fly at one another&rsquo;s throats should
occasion arise. Formidable as these armaments now seem,
however, the developments of the not very distant future will
probably make them quite obsolete; and sooner or later, as
science develops yet more deadly implements of destruction,
the time must come when communal intelligence will rebel at
the suicidal folly of the international attitude that characterized,
for example, the opening decade of the 20th century. At some
time, after the first period of cosmopolitanism shall be ushered
in as a tenth ethnic period, it will come to be recognized that
there is a word fraught with fuller meanings even than the word
patriotism. That word is humanitarianism. The enlightened
generation that realizes the full implications of that word will
doubtless marvel that their ancestors of the third period of
civilization should have risen up as nations and slaughtered one
another by thousands to settle a dispute about a geographical
boundary. Such a procedure will appear to have been quite as
barbarous as the cannibalistic practices of their yet more remote
ancestors, and distinctly less rational, since cannibalism might
sometimes save its practiser from starvation, whereas warfare
of the civilized type was a purely destructive agency.</p>

<p>Equally obvious must it appear to the cosmopolite of some
generation of the future that quality rather than mere numbers
must determine the efficiency of any given community. Race
suicide will then cease to be a bugbear; and it will no longer be
considered rational to keep up the census at the cost of propagating
low orders of intelligence, to feed the ranks of paupers,
defectives and criminals. On the contrary it will be thought
fitting that man should become the conscious arbiter of his own
racial destiny to the extent of applying whatever laws of heredity
he knows or may acquire in the interests of his own species, as
he has long applied them in the case of domesticated animals.
The survival and procreation of the unfit will then cease to be
a menace to the progress of civilization. It does not follow that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
all men will be brought to a dead level of equality of body and
mind, nor that individual competition will cease; but the average
physical mental status of the race will be raised immeasurably
through the virtual elimination of that vast company of defectives
which to-day constitutes so threatening an obstacle to racial
progress. There are millions of men in Europe and America
to-day whose whole mental equipment&mdash;despite the fact that they
have been taught to read and write&mdash;is far more closely akin to
the average of the Upper Period of Barbarism than to the highest
standards of their own time; and these undeveloped or atavistic
persons have on the average more offspring than are produced
by the more highly cultured and intelligent among their contemporaries.
&ldquo;Race suicide&rdquo; is thereby prevented, but the progress
of civilization is no less surely handicapped. We may well
believe that the cosmopolite of the future, aided by science,
will find rational means to remedy this strange illogicality. In so
doing he will exercise a more consciously purposeful function,
and perhaps a more directly potent influence, in determining
the line of human progress than he has hitherto attempted to
assume, notwithstanding the almost infinitely varied character
of the experiments through which he has worked his way from
savagery to civilization.</p>

<p>All these considerations tend to define yet more clearly the
ultimate goal towards which the progressive civilization of past
and present appears to be trending. The contemplation
of this goal brings into view the outlines of a vastly
<span class="sidenote">Ethical evolution.</span>
suggestive evolutionary cycle. For it appears that
the social condition of cosmopolite man, so far as the present-day
view can predict it, will represent a state of things, magnified
to world-dimensions, that was curiously adumbrated by the social
system of the earliest savage. At the very beginning of the
journey through savagery, mankind, we may well believe, consisted
of a limited tribe, representing no great range or variety
of capacity, and an almost absolute identity of interests. Thanks
to this community of interests,&mdash;which was fortified by the
recognition of blood-relationship among all members of the tribe,&mdash;a
principle which we now define as &ldquo;the greatest ultimate
good to the greatest number&rdquo; found practical, even if unwitting,
recognition; and therein lay the germs of all the moral development
of the future. But obvious identity of interests could be
recognized only so long as the tribe remained very small. So
soon as its numbers became large, patent diversities of interest,
based on individual selfishness, must appear, to obscure the
larger harmony. And as savage man migrated hither and thither,
occupying new regions and thus developing new tribes and
ultimately a diversity of &ldquo;races,&rdquo; all idea of community of
interests, as between race and race, must have been absolutely
banished. It was the obvious and patent fact that each race was
more or less at rivalry, in disharmony, with all the others. In
the hard struggle for subsistence, the expansion of one race meant
the downfall of another. So far as any principle of &ldquo;greatest
good&rdquo; remained in evidence, it applied solely to the members of
one&rsquo;s own community, or even to one&rsquo;s particular phratry or
gens.</p>

<p>Barbaric man, thanks to his conquest of animal and vegetable
nature, was able to extend the size of the unified community,
and hence to develop through diverse and intricate channels
the application of the principle of &ldquo;greatest good&rdquo; out of which
the idea of right and wrong was elaborated. But quite as little
as the savage did he think of extending the application of the
principle beyond the bounds of his own race. The laws with
which he gave expression to his ethical conceptions applied,
of necessity, to his own people alone. The gods with which his
imagination peopled the world were local in habitat, devoted
to the interests of his race only, and at enmity with the gods of
rival peoples. As between nation and nation, the only principle
of ethics that ever occurred to him was that might makes right.
Civilized man for a long time advanced but slowly upon this view
of international morality. No Egyptian or Babylonian or
Hebrew or Greek or Roman ever hesitated to attack a weaker
nation on the ground that it would be wrong to do so. And
few indeed are the instances in which even a modern nation has
judged an international question on any other basis than that
of self-interest. It was not till towards the close of the 19th
century that an International Peace Conference gave tangible
witness that the idea of fellowship of nations was finding recognition;
and in the same recent period history has recorded the first
instance of a powerful nation vanquishing a weaker one without
attempting to exact at least an &ldquo;indemnifying&rdquo; tribute.</p>

<p>But the citizen of the future, if the auguries of the present
prove true, will be able to apply principles of right and wrong
without reference to national boundaries. He will understand
that the interests of the entire human family are, in the last
analysis, common interests. The census through which he
attempts to estimate &ldquo;the greatest good of the greatest number&rdquo;
must include, not his own nation merely, but the remotest
member of the human race. On this universal basis must be
founded that absolute standard of ethics which will determine
the relations of cosmopolite man with his fellows. When this
ideal is attained, mankind will again represent a single family,
as it did in the day when our primeval ancestors first entered
on the pathway of progress; but it will be a family whose habitat
has been extended from the narrow glade of some tropical forest
to the utmost habitable confines of the globe. Each member of
this family will be permitted to enjoy the greatest amount of
liberty consistent with the like liberty of every other member;
but the interests of the few will everywhere be recognized as
subservient to the interests of the many, and such recognition
of mutual interests will establish the practical criterion for the
interpretation of international affairs.</p>

<p>But such an extension of the altruistic principle by no means
presupposes the elimination of egoistic impulses&mdash;of individualism.
On the contrary, we must suppose that man at
the highest stages of culture will be, even as was the
<span class="sidenote">Progress and efficiency.</span>
savage, a seeker after the greatest attainable degree of
comfort for the least necessary expenditure of energy.
The pursuit of this ideal has been from first to last the ultimate
impelling force in nature urging man forward. The only change
has been a change in the interpretation of the ideal, an altered
estimate as to what manner of things are most worth the purchase-price
of toil and self-denial. That the things most worth the
having cannot, generally speaking, be secured without such toil
and self-denial, is a lesson that began to be inculcated while man
was a savage, and that has never ceased to be reiterated generation
after generation. It is the final test of progressive civilization
that a given effort shall produce a larger and larger modicum
of average individual comfort. That is why the great inventions
that have increased man&rsquo;s efficiency as a worker have been the
necessary prerequisites to racial progress. Stated otherwise, that
is why the industrial factor is everywhere the most powerful
factor in civilization; and why the economic interpretation is
the most searching interpretation of history at its every stage.
It is the basal fact that progress implies increased average
working efficiency&mdash;a growing ratio between average effort and
average achievement&mdash;that gives sure warrant for such a prognostication
as has just been attempted concerning the future
industrial unification of our race. The efforts of civilized man
provide him, on the average, with a marvellous range of comforts,
as contrasted with those that rewarded the most strenuous
efforts of savage or barbarian, to whom present-day necessaries
would have been undreamed-of luxuries. But the ideal ratio
between effort and result has by no means been achieved;
nor will it have been until the inventive brain of man has provided
a civilization in which a far higher percentage of citizens
will find the life-vocations to which they are best adapted by
nature, and in which, therefore, the efforts of the average worker
may be directed with such vigour, enthusiasm and interest as can
alone make for true efficiency; a civilization adjusted to such
an economic balance that the average man may live in reasonable
comfort without heart-breaking strain, and yet accumulate a
sufficient surplus to ensure ease and serenity for his declining
days. Such, seemingly, should be the normal goal of progressive
civilization. Doubtless mankind in advancing towards that
goal will institute many changes that could by no possibility be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>410</span>
foretold, but (to summarize the views just presented) it seems a
safe augury from present-day conditions and tendencies that the
important lines of progress will include (1) the organic betterment
of the race through wise application of the laws of heredity;
(2) the lessening of international jealousies and the consequent
minimizing of the drain upon communal resources that attends
a military régime; and (3) an ever-increasing movement towards
the industrial and economic unification of the world.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;A list of works dealing with the savage and
barbarous periods of human development will be found appended
to the article ANTHROPOLOGY. Special reference may here be made
to E.B. Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Early History of Mankind</i> (1865), <i>Primitive Culture</i>
(1871) and <i>Anthropology</i> (1881); Lord Avebury&rsquo;s <i>Prehistoric Times</i>
(new edition, 1900) and <i>Origin of Civilization</i> (new edition, 1902);
A.H. Keane&rsquo;s <i>Man Past and Present</i> (1899); and Lewis H. Morgan&rsquo;s
<i>Ancient Society</i> (1877). The earliest attempt at writing a history
of civilization which has any value for the 20th-century reader
was F. Guizot&rsquo;s in 1828-1830, a handy English translation by
William Hazlitt being included in Bohn&rsquo;s Standard Library under
the title of <i>The History of Civilization</i>. The earlier lectures, delivered
at the Old Sorbonne, deal with the general progress of
European civilization, whilst the greater part of the work is an
account of the growth of civilization in France. Guizot&rsquo;s attitude
is somewhat antiquated, but this book still has usefulness as a storehouse
of facts. T.H. Buckle&rsquo;s famous work, <i>The History of Civilization
in England</i> (1857-1861), though only a gigantic unfinished
introduction to the author&rsquo;s proposed enterprise, holds an important
place in historical literature on account of the new method which
it introduced, and has given birth to a considerable number of
valuable books on similar lines, such as Lecky&rsquo;s <i>History of European
Morals</i> (1869) and <i>Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe</i>
(1865). J.W. Draper&rsquo;s <i>History of the Intellectual Development of
Europe</i> (1861) undertook, from the American stand-point, &ldquo;the
labour of arranging the evidence offered by the intellectual history
of Europe in accordance with physiological principles, so as to
illustrate the orderly progress of civilization.&rdquo; Its objective treatment
and wealth of learning still give it great value to the student.
Since the third quarter of the 19th century it may be said that all
serious historical work has been more or less a history of civilization
as displayed in all countries and ages, and a bibliography of the
works bearing on the subject would be coextensive with the catalogue
of a complete historical library. Special mention, however,
may be made of such important and suggestive works as C.H.
Pearson&rsquo;s <i>National Life and Character</i> (1893); Benjamin Kidd&rsquo;s
<i>Social Evolution</i> (1894) and <i>Principles of Western Civilization</i>
(1902); Edward Eggleston&rsquo;s <i>Transit of Civilization</i> (1901); C.
Seignobos&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de la civilisation</i> (1887); C. Faulmann&rsquo;s <i>Illustrirte
Culturgeschichte</i> (1881); G. Ducoudray&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de la
civilisation</i> (1886); J. von Hellwald&rsquo;s <i>Kulturgeschichte</i> (1896);
J. Lippert&rsquo;s <i>Kulturgeschichte der Menschheit</i> (1886); O. Henne-am-Rhyn&rsquo;s
<i>Die Kultur der Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft</i> (1890);
G. Kurth&rsquo;s <i>Origines de la civilisation moderne</i> (1886), &amp;c. The vast
collection of modern works on sociology, from Herbert Spencer
onwards, should also be consulted; see bibliography attached to
the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sociology</a></span>. The historical method on which practically
all the articles of the present edition of the <i>Ency. Brit.</i> are planned,
makes the whole work itself in essentials the most comprehensive
history of civilization in existence.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIVIL LAW<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span>, a phrase which, with its Latin equivalent <i>jus
civile</i>, has been used in a great variety of meanings. <i>Jus civile</i>
was sometimes used to distinguish that portion of the Roman
law which was the proper or ancient law of the city or state of
Rome from the <i>jus gentium</i>, or the law common to all the nations
comprising the Roman world, which was incorporated with
the former through the agency of the praetorian edicts. This
historical distinction remained as a permanent principle of division
in the body of the Roman law. One of the first propositions of
the Institutes of Justinian is the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Jus autem civile
vel gentium ita dividitur. Omnes populi qui legibus et moribus
reguntur partim suo proprio, partim communi omnium hominum
jure utuntur; nam quod quisque populus ipsi sibi jus constituit,
id ipsius civitatis proprium est, vocaturque jus civile quasi jus
proprium ipsius civitatis. Quod vero naturalis ratio inter omnes
homines constituit, id apud omnes peraeque custoditur, vocaturque
jus gentium quasi quo jure omnes gentes utuntur.&rdquo; The
<i>jus gentium</i> of this passage is elsewhere identified with <i>jus naturale</i>,
so that the distinction comes to be one between civil law and
natural or divine law. The municipal or private law of a state
is sometimes described as civil law in distinction to public or
international law. Again, the municipal law of a state may be
divided into civil law and criminal law. The phrase, however,
is applied <i>par excellence</i> to the system of law created by the
genius of the Roman people, and handed down by them to the
nations of the modern world (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Law</a></span>). The civil law
in this sense would be distinguished from the local or national
law of modern states. The civil law in this sense is further to
be distinguished from that adaptation of its principles to ecclesiastical
purposes which is known as the canon law (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIVIL LIST<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span>, the English term for the account in which are
contained all the expenses immediately applicable to the support
of the British sovereign&rsquo;s household and the honour and
dignity of the crown. An annual sum is settled by the British
parliament at the beginning of the reign on the sovereign, and is
charged on the consolidated fund. But it is only from the reign
of William IV. that the sum thus voted has been restricted solely
to the personal expenses of the crown. Before his accession
many charges properly belonging to the ordinary expenses of
government had been placed on the civil list. The history
<span class="sidenote">History</span>
of the civil list dates from the reign of William and
Mary. Before the Revolution no distinction had
been made between the expenses of government in time of
peace and the expenses relating to the personal dignity and
support of the sovereign. The ordinary revenues derived from
the hereditary revenues of the crown, and from certain taxes
voted for life to the king at the beginning of each reign, were
supposed to provide for the support of the sovereign&rsquo;s dignity
and the civil government, as well as for the public defence in
time of peace. Any saving made by the king in the expenditure
touching the government of the country or its defence would go to
swell his privy purse. But with the Revolution a step forward
was made towards the establishment of the principle that the
expenses relating to the support of the crown should be separated
from the ordinary expenses of the state. The evils of the old
system under which no appropriation was made of the ordinary
revenue granted to the crown for life had been made manifest
in the reigns of Charles II. and James II.; it was their control
of these large revenues that made them so independent of
parliament. Moreover, while the civil government and the defences
suffered, the king could use these revenues as he liked. The
parliament of William and Mary fixed the revenue of the crown
in time of peace at £1,200,000 per annum; of this sum about
£700,000 was appropriated towards the &ldquo;civil list.&rdquo; But from
this the sovereign was to defray the expenses of the civil service
and the payment of pensions, as well as the cost of the support
of the royal household and his own personal expenses. It was
from this that the term &ldquo;civil list&rdquo; arose, to distinguish it from
the statement of military and naval charges. The revenue voted
to meet the civil list consisted of the hereditary revenues of the
crown and a part of the excise duties. Certain changes and additions
were made in the sources of revenue thus appropriated
between the reign of William and Mary and the accession of
George III., when a different system was adopted. Generally
speaking, however, the sources of revenue remained as settled
at the Revolution.</p>

<p>Anne had the same civil list, estimated to produce an annual
income of £700,000. During her reign a debt of £1,200,000 was
incurred. This debt was paid by parliament and
charged on the civil list itself. George I. enjoyed the
<span class="sidenote">Anne, George I. and George II.</span>
same revenue by parliamentary grant, in addition to
an annual sum of £120,000 on the aggregate fund.
A debt of £1,000,000 was incurred, and discharged by parliament
in the same manner as Anne&rsquo;s debt had been. To George II.
a civil list of £800,000 as a minimum was granted, parliament
undertaking to make up any deficiency if the sources of income
appropriated to its service fell short of that sum. Thus in 1746
a debt of £456,000 was paid by parliament on the civil list.
On the accession of George III. a change was made in the system
of the civil list. Hitherto the sources of revenue appropriated
<span class="sidenote">George III.</span>
to the service of the civil list had been settled on
the crown. If these revenues exceeded the sum they
were computed to produce annually, the surplus went to the king.
George III., however, surrendered the life-interest in the hereditary
revenues and the excise duties hitherto voted to defray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
the civil list expenditure, and any claim to a surplus for a fixed
amount. The king still retained other large sources of revenue
which were not included in the civil list, and were free from the
control of parliament. The revenues from which the civil list
had been defrayed were henceforward to be carried into, and
made part of, the aggregate fund. In their place a fixed civil
list was granted&mdash;at first of £723,000 per annum, to be increased
to £800,000 on the falling in of certain annuities to members
of the royal family. From this £800,000 the king&rsquo;s household
and the honour and dignity of the crown were to be supported,
as well as the civil service offices, pensions and other charges
still laid on the list.</p>

<p>During the reign of George III. the civil list played an important
part in the history of the struggle on the part of the king
to establish the royal ascendancy. From the revenue appropriated
to its service came a large portion of the money employed
by the king in creating places and pensions for his supporters
in parliament, and, under the colour of the royal bounty, bribery
was practised on a large scale. No limit was set to the amount
applicable to the pensions charged on the civil list, so long as the
sum granted could meet the demand; and there was no principle
on which the grant was regulated. Secret pensions at the king&rsquo;s
pleasure were paid out of it, and in every way the independence
of parliament was menaced; and though the more legitimate
expenses of the royal household were diminished by the king&rsquo;s
penurious style of living, and though many charges not directly
connected with the king&rsquo;s personal expenditure were removed,
the amount was constantly exceeded, and applications were
made from time to time to parliament to pay off debts incurred;
and thus opportunity was given for criticism. In 1769 a debt
of £513,511 was paid off in arrears; and in spite of the demand
for accounts and for an inquiry into the cause of the debt, the
<span class="sidenote">Indebtedness of civil list.</span>
ministry succeeded in securing this vote without
granting such information. All attempts to investigate
the civil list were successfully resisted, though Lord
Chatham went so far as to declare himself convinced
that the funds were expended in corrupting members of parliament.
Again, in 1777, an application was made to parliament
to pay off £618,340 of debts; and in view of the growing discontent
Lord North no longer dared to withhold accounts. Yet,
in spite of strong opposition and free criticism, not only was the
amount voted, but also a further £100,000 per annum, thus
raising the civil list to an annual sum of £900,000.</p>

<p>In 1779, at a time when the expenditure of the country and
the national debt had been enormously increased by the American
War, the general dissatisfaction found voice in parliament,
and the abuses of the civil list were specially singled out for
attack. Many petitions were presented to the House of Commons
praying for its reduction, and a motion was made in the House
of Lords in the same sense, though it was rejected. In 1780
Burke brought forward his scheme of economic reform, but his
name was already associated with the growing desire to remedy
the evils of the civil list by the publication in 1769 of his pamphlet
on &ldquo;The Causes of the Present Discontent.&rdquo; In this scheme
Burke freely animadverts on the profusion and abuse of the
civil list, criticizing the useless and obsolete offices and the
offices performed by deputy. In every department he discovers
jobbery, waste and peculation. His proposal was that the many
offices should be reduced and consolidated, that the pension
list should be brought down to a fixed sum of £60,000 per annum,
and that pensions should be conferred only to reward merit or
fulfil real public charity. All pensions were to be paid at the
exchequer. He proposed also that the civil list should be
divided into classes, an arrangement which later was carried
into effect. In 1780 Burke succeeded in bringing in his Establishment
Bill; but though at first it met with considerable support,
and was even read a second time, Lord North&rsquo;s government
defeated it in committee. The next year the bill was again
introduced into the House of Commons, and Pitt made his
first speech in its favour. The bill was, however, lost on the
second reading.</p>

<p>In 1782 the Rockingham ministry, pledged to economic
reform, came into power; and the Civil List Act 1782 was
introduced and carried with the express object of limiting the
patronage and influence of ministers, or, in other
<span class="sidenote">Civil List Act 1782.</span>
words, the ascendancy of the crown over parliament.
Not only did the act effect the abolition of a
number of useless offices, but it also imposed restraints on the
issue of secret service money, and made provision for a more
effectual supervision of the royal expenditure. As to the pension
list, the annual amount was to be limited to £95,000; no pension
to any one person was to exceed £1200, and all pensions were to
be paid at the exchequer, thus putting a stop to the secret
pensions payable during pleasure. Moreover, pensions were
only to be bestowed in the way of royal bounty for persons in
distress or as a reward for merit. Another very important
change was made by this act: the civil list was divided into
classes, and a fixed amount was to be appropriated to each
class. The following were the classes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed1">
<p>1. Pensions and allowances of the royal family.</p>
<p>2. Payment of salaries of lord chancellor, speaker and judges.</p>
<p>3. Salaries of ministers to foreign courts resident at the same.</p>
<p>4. Approved bills of tradesmen, artificers and labourers for any
   article supplied and work done for His Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>5. Menial servants of the household.</p>
<p>6. Pension list.</p>
<p>7. Salaries of all other places payable out of the civil list revenues.</p>
<p>8. Salaries and pensions of treasurer or commissioners of the
   treasury and of the chancellor of the exchequer.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet debt was still the condition of the civil list down to the
end of the reign, in spite of the reforms established by the
Rockingham ministry, and notwithstanding the removal from
the list of many charges unconnected with the king&rsquo;s personal
expenses. The debts discharged by parliament between 1782,
the date of the passing of the Civil List Act, and the end of
George III.&rsquo;s reign, amounted to £2,300,000. In all, during
his reign £3,398,061 of debt owing by the civil list was paid off.</p>

<p>With the regency the civil list was increased by £70,000 per
annum, and a special grant of £100,000 was settled on the prince
regent. In 1816 the annual amount was settled at £1,083,727,
including the establishment of the king, now insane; though
the civil list was relieved from some annuities payable to the
royal family. Nevertheless, the fund still continued charged
with such civil expenses as the salaries of judges, ambassadors
and officers of state, and with pensions granted for public
services. Other reforms were made as regards the definition
of the several classes of expenditure, while the expenses of the
royal household were henceforth to be audited by a treasury
official&mdash;the auditor of the civil list. On the accession of George
IV. the civil list, freed from the expenses of the late king, was
settled at £845,727. On William IV. coming to the throne a
sum of £510,000 per annum was fixed for the service of the civil
list. The king at the same time surrendered all the sources of
revenue enjoyed by his predecessors, apart from the civil list,
represented by the hereditary revenues of Scotland&mdash;the Irish
civil list, the droits of the crown and admiralty, the 4½% duties,
the West India duties, and other casual revenues hitherto vested
in the crown, and independent of parliament. The revenues
of the duchy of Lancaster were still retained by the crown.
In return for this surrender and the diminished sum voted,
the civil list was relieved from all the charges relating rather
to the civil government than to the support of the dignity of the
crown and the royal household. The future expenditure was
divided into five classes, and a fixed annual sum was appropriated
to each class. The pension list was reduced to £75,000. The
king resisted an attempt on the part of the select committee to
reduce the salaries of the officers of state on the grounds that
this touched his prerogative, and the ministry of Earl Grey
yielded to his remonstrance.</p>

<p>The civil list of Queen Victoria was settled on the same principles
as that of William IV. A considerable reduction
was made in the aggregate annual sum voted,
from £510,000 to £385,000, and the pension list was
<span class="sidenote">Queen Victoria&rsquo;s civil list.</span>
separated from the ordinary civil list. The civil list
proper was divided into the following five classes, with a fixed
sum appropriated to each:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span></p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 50%;" summary="Contents">

<tr><td class="tcl">Privy purse</td>  <td class="tcr">£60,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Salaries of household</td>  <td class="tcr">131,260</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Expenses of household</td>  <td class="tcr">172,500</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Royal bounty, &amp;c.</td>  <td class="tcr">13,200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Unappropriated</td>  <td class="tcr">8,040</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In addition the queen might, on the advice of her ministers,
grant pensions up to £1200 per annum, in accordance with a
resolution of the House of Commons of February 18th, 1834,
&ldquo;to such persons as have just claims on the royal beneficence
or who, by their personal services to the crown, by the performance
of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in
science and attainments in literature and art, have merited the
gracious consideration of the sovereign and the gratitude of
their country.&rdquo; The service of these pensions increased the
annual sum devoted to support the dignity of the crown and the
expenses of the household to about £409,000. The list of pensions
must be laid before parliament within thirty days of 20th June.
Thus the civil list was reduced in amount, and relieved from the
very charges which gave it its name as distinct from the statement
of military and naval charges. It now really only dealt
with the support of the dignity and honour of the crown and
the royal household. The arrangement was most successful,
and during the last three reigns there was no application to
parliament for the discharge of debts incurred on the civil list.</p>

<p>The death of Queen Victoria rendered it necessary that
a renewed provision should be made for the civil list; and King
Edward VII., following former precedents, placed
unreservedly at the disposal of parliament his hereditary
<span class="sidenote">Civil List Act 1901.</span>
revenues. A select committee of the House of
Commons was appointed to consider the provisions of the civil
list for the crown, and to report also on the question of grants
for the honourable support and maintenance of Her Majesty the
Queen and the members of the royal family. The committee in
their conclusions were guided to a considerable extent by the
actual civil list expenditure during the last ten years of the last
reign, and made certain recommendations which, without undue
interference with the sovereign&rsquo;s personal arrangements, tended
towards increased efficiency and economy in the support of the
sovereign&rsquo;s household and the honour and dignity of the crown.
On their report was based the Civil List Act 1901, which established
the new civil list. The system that the hereditary revenues
should as before be paid into the exchequer and be part of the
consolidated fund was maintained. The amount payable for
the civil list was increased from £385,000 to £470,000. In the
application of this sum the number of classes of expenditure
to which separate amounts were to be appropriated was increased
from five to six. The following was the new arrangement of
classes:&mdash;1st class, Their Majesties&rsquo; privy purse, £110,000;
2nd class, salaries of His Majesty&rsquo;s household and retired allowances,
£125,800; 3rd class, expenses of His Majesty&rsquo;s household,
£193,000; 4th class, works (the interior repair and decoration
of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle), £20,000; 5th class,
royal bounty, alms and special services, £13,200; 6th class,
unappropriated, £8000. The system relating to civil list pensions,
established by the Civil List Act 1837, continued to apply, but
the pensions were not regarded as chargeable on the sum paid
for the civil list. The committee also advised that the mastership
of the Buckhounds should not be continued; and the king, on
the advice of his ministers, agreed to accept their recommendation.
The maintenance of the royal hunt thus ceased to be a
charge on the civil list. The annuities of £20,000 to the prince
of Wales, of £10,000 to the princess of Wales, and of £18,000 to
His Majesty&rsquo;s three daughters, were not included in the civil
list, though they were conferred by the same act. Other grants
made by special acts of parliament to members of the royal
family were also excluded from it; these were £6000 to the
princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, £6000 to the princess
Louise (duchess of Argyll), £25,000 to the duke of Connaught,
£6000 to the duchess of Albany, £6000 to the princess Beatrice
(Henry of Battenberg), and £3000 to the duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It may be interesting to compare with the British civil list the
corresponding figures in other countries. These are as follows,
the figures being those, for convenience, of 1905. Spain, £280,000,
exclusive of allowances to members of the royal family; Portugal,
<span class="sidenote">Figures in other countries.</span>
£97,333, in addition to £1333 to the queen-consort&mdash;total
grant to the royal family, £116,700; Italy, £602,000,
from which was deducted £16,000 for the children of the
deceased Prince Amedeo, duke of Aosta, £16,000 to Prince
Tommaso, duke of Genoa, and £40,000 to Queen Margherita;
Belgium, £140,000; Netherlands, £50,000, with, in addition,
£4000 for the maintenance of the royal palaces; Germany, £770,500
(<i>Krondotations Rente</i>), the sovereign also possessing large private
property (<i>Kronfideikommiss und Schatullgüter</i>), the revenue from
which contributed to the expenditure of the court and the members
of the royal family; Denmark, £55,500, in addition to £6600 to
the heir-apparent; Norway, £38,888; Sweden, £72,700; Greece,
£52,000, which included £4000 each from Great Britain, France

Servia, £48,000; Bulgaria, £40,000, besides £30,000 for maintenance
of palaces, &amp;c.; Montenegro, £8300; Russia had no civil list, the
sovereign having all the revenue from the crown domains (actual
amount unknown, but supposed to amount to over £4,000,000);
the president of the French Republic had a salary of £24,000 a
year, with a further £24,000 for expenses; and the president of the
United States had a salary of $50,000 (from 1909, $75,000).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CIVIL SERVICE<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span>, the generic name given to the aggregate of
all the public servants, or paid civil administrators and clerks,
of a state. It is the machinery by which the executive, through
the various administrations, carries on the central government
of the country.</p>

<p><i>British Empire.</i>&mdash;The appointments to the civil service until
the year 1855 were made by nomination, with an examination
not sufficient to form an intellectual or even a physical test.
It was only after much consideration and almost years of discussion
that the nomination system was abandoned. Various
commissions reported on the civil service, and orders in council
were issued. Finally in 1855 a qualifying examination of a
stringent character was instituted, and in 1870 the principle
of open competition was adopted as a general rule. On the
report of the Playfair Commission (1876), an order in council
was issued dividing the civil service into an upper and lower
division. The order in council directed that a lower division
should be constituted, and men and boy clerks holding permanent
positions replaced the temporary assistants and writers.
The &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; assistant was not found to be advantageous
to the service. In December 1886 a new class of assistant
clerks was formed to replace the men copyists. In 1887 the
Ridley Commission reported on the civil service establishment.
In 1890 two orders in council were issued based on the reports
of the Ridley Commission, which sat from 1886 to 1890. The
first order constituted what is now known as the second division
of the civil service. The second order in council concerned the
officers of the 1st class; and provision was made for the possible
promotion of the second division clerks to the first division after
eight years&rsquo; service.</p>

<p>The whole system is under the administration of the civil
service commissioners, and power is given to them, with the
approval of the treasury, to prescribe the subjects of examination,
limits of age, &amp;c. The age is fixed for compulsory retirement
at sixty-five. In exceptional cases a prolongation of five
years is within the powers of the civil service commissioners.
The examination for 1st class clerkships is held concurrently
with that of the civil service of India and Eastern cadetships
in the colonial service. Candidates can compete for all three
or for two. In addition to the intellectual test the candidate
must fulfil the conditions of age (22 to 24), must present recommendations
as to character, and pass a medical examination.
This examination approximates closely to the university type
of education. Indeed, there is little chance of success except
for candidates who have had a successful university career,
and frequently, in addition, special preparation by a private
teacher. The subjects include the language and literature of
England, France, Germany, Italy, ancient Greece and Rome,
Sanskrit and Arabic, mathematics (pure and applied), natural
science (chemistry, physics, zoology, &amp;c.), history (English,
Greek, Roman and general  modern), political economy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
economic history, mental and moral philosophy, Roman and
English law and political science. The candidate is obliged to
reach a certain standard of knowledge in each subject before
any marks at all are allowed him. This rule was made to prevent
success by mere cramming, and to ensure competent knowledge
on the basis of real study.</p>

<p>The maximum scale of the salaries of clerks of Class I. is as
follows:&mdash;3rd class, £200 a year, increasing by £20 a year to
£500; 2nd class, £600, increasing by £25 a year to £800; 1st
class, £850, increasing by £50 a year to £1000. Their pensions
are fixed by the Superannuation Act 1859, 22 Vict. c. 26:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;To any person who shall have served ten years and upwards,
and under eleven years, an annual allowance of ten-sixtieths of
the annual salary and emoluments of his office:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For eleven years and under twelve years, an annual allowance
of eleven-sixtieths of such salary and emoluments:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in like manner a further addition to the annual allowance
of one-sixtieth in respect of each additional year of such service,
until the completion of a period of service of forty years, when the
annual allowance of forty-sixtieths may be granted; and no additions
shall be made in respect of any service beyond forty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;ordinary annual holidays allowed to officers&rdquo; (1st class)
&ldquo;shall not exceed thirty-six week-days during each of their first
ten years of service and forty-eight week-days thereafter.&rdquo; Order
in Council, 15th August 1890.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Within that maximum heads of departments have now, as
they have hitherto had, an absolute discretion in fixing the annual
leave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Sick leave can be granted on full salary for not more than six
months, on half-salary for another six months.</p>

<p>The scale of salary for 2nd division clerks begins at £70 a year,
increasing by £5 to £100; then £100 a year, increasing by £7, 10s.
to £190; and then £190 a year, increasing by £10 to £250. The
highest is £300 to £500. Advancement in the 2nd division to the
higher ranks depends on merit, not seniority. The ordinary
annual holiday of the 2nd division clerks is 14 working days for
the first five years, and 21 working days afterwards. They can
be allowed sick leave for six months on full pay and six months
on half-pay. The subjects of their examination are: (1) handwriting
and orthography, including copying MS.; (2) arithmetic;
(3) English composition; (4) précis, including indexing and digest
of returns; (5) book-keeping and shorthand writing; (6) geography
and English history; (7) Latin; (8) French; (9) German;
(10) elementary mathematics; (11) inorganic chemistry
with elements of physics. Not more than four of the subjects
(4) to (11) can be taken. The candidate must be between the
ages of 17 and 20. A certain number of the places in the 2nd
division were reserved for the candidates from the boy clerks
appointed under the old system. The competition is severe, only
about one out of every ten candidates being successful. Candidates
are allowed a choice of departments subject to the exigencies
of the services.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There is also a class of boy copyists who are almost entirely
employed in London, a few in Dublin and Edinburgh, and, very
seldom, in some provincial towns. The subjects of their examination
are: <i>Obligatory</i>&mdash;handwriting and orthography, arithmetic and
English composition. <i>Optional</i>&mdash;(any two of the following): (1)
copying MS.; (2) geography; (3) English history; (4) translation
from one of the following languages&mdash;Latin, French or German;
(5) Euclid, bk. i. and ii., and algebra, up to and including simple
equations; (6) rudiments of chemistry and physics. Candidates
must be between the ages of 15 and 18. They have no claims to
superannuation or compensation allowance. Boy copyists are not
retained after the age of 20.</p>
</div>

<p>Candidates for the civil service of India take the same examination
as for 1st class clerkships. Candidates successful in
the examination must subsequently spend one year in England.
They receive for that year £150 if they elect to live at one of the
universities or colleges approved by the secretary of state for
India. They are submitted to a final examination in the following
subjects&mdash;Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure,
the principal vernacular language of the province to which they
are assigned, the Indian Evidence Act (these three subjects are
compulsory), either Hindu and Mahommedan Law, or Sanskrit,
Arabic or Persian, Burmese (for Burma only). A candidate may
not take Arabic or Sanskrit both in the first examination and in
the final. They must also pass a thorough examination in riding.
On reaching India their salary begins at 400 rupees a month.
They may take, as leave, one-fourth of the time on active
service in periods strictly limited by regulation. After 25 years&rsquo;
service (of which 21 must be active service) they can retire on a
pension of £1000 a year. The unit of administration is the district.
At the head of the district is an executive officer called either
collector-magistrate or deputy-commissioner. In most provinces
he is responsible to the commissioner, who corresponds directly
with the provincial government. The Indian civilian after four
years&rsquo; probation in both branches of the service is called upon
to elect whether he will enter the revenue or judicial department,
and this choice as a rule is held to be final for his future work.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Candidates for the Indian Forest Service have to pass a competitive
examination, one of the compulsory subjects being German
or French. They have also to pass a severe medical examination,
especially in their powers of vision and hearing. They must be
between the ages of 18 and 22. Successful candidates are required
to pass a three years&rsquo; course, with a final examination, seven
terms of the course at an approved school of forestry, the rest of
the time receiving practical instruction in continental European
forests. On reaching India they start as assistant conservators at
380 rupees a month. The highest salary, that of inspector-general
of forests, in the Indian Forest Service is 2650 rupees a month.</p>

<p>The Indian Police Service is entered by a competitive examination
of very much the same kind as for the forest service, except that
special subjects such as German and botany are not included. The
candidates are limited in age to 19 and 21. They must pass a
riding examination. A free passage out is given them. They are
allotted as probationers, their wishes being consulted as far as
possible as to their province. A probationer receives 300 rupees
a month. A district superintendent can rise to 1200 rupees a
month, while there are a few posts with a salary of 3000 rupees a
month in the police service. The leave and pension in both these
departments follow the general rules for Indian services.</p>
</div>

<p>The civil service also includes student interpreterships for
China, Japan and Siam, and for the Ottoman dominions, Persia,
Greece and Morocco. Both these classes of student interpreters
are selected by open competition. Their object is to supply the
consular service in the above-named countries with persons
having a thorough knowledge of the language of the country
in which they serve.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the first case, China, Japan, &amp;c., they learn their language in
the country itself, receiving £200 as probationers. Then they become
assistants in a consulate. The highest post is that of consul-general.
In the case of student interpreters for the Ottoman dominions,
Persia, Greece and Morocco, the successful candidates learn
their languages at Oxford. Turkish is taught gratuitously, but
they pay the usual fees for other languages. At Oxford they receive
£200 a year for two years. On leaving Oxford they become assistants
under the embassy at Constantinople, the legations at Teheran,
Athens or Morocco, or at one of H.B.M. consulates. As assistants
they receive £300 a year. The consuls, the highest post to which
they can reach, receive in the Levant from £500 to £1600 a year.
The civil services of Ceylon, Hong-Kong, the Straits Settlements,
and the Malay Peninsula are supplied by the Eastern cadetships.
The limits of age for the examination are 18 and 24. The cadets
are required to learn the native language of the colony or
dependency to which they are assigned. In the case of the Straits
Settlements and Malay cadets they may have to learn Chinese or
Tamil, as well as the native language. The salaries are: passed
cadets, 3500 rupees per annum, gradually increasing until first-class
officers receive from 12,000 to 18,000 rupees per annum. They are
allowed three months&rsquo; vacation on full pay in two years, and leave
of absence on half-pay after six years&rsquo; service, or before that if
urgently needed. They can retire for ill-health after ten years with
fifteen-sixtieths of their annual salary. Otherwise they can add
one-sixtieth of their annual salary to their pension for every
additional year&rsquo;s service up to thirty-five years&rsquo; service.</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of the general rule of open competition, there are still
a few departments where the system of <i>nomination</i> obtains,
accompanied by a severe test of knowledge, either active or
implied. Such are the foreign office, British Museum, and board
of education.</p>

<p>The employment of women in the civil service has been
principally developed in the post office. Women are employed
in the post office as female clerks, counter clerks, telegraphists,
returners, sorters and post-mistresses all over the United Kingdom.
The board of agriculture, the customs and the India office
employ women. The department of agriculture, the board of
education generally, the local government board, all to a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
extent employ women, whilst in the home office there are an
increasing number of women inspectors of workshops and
factories.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1881 the postmaster-general took a decided step in favour of
female employment, and with the consent of the treasury instituted
female clerkships. Female clerks do not come in contact with the
public. Their duties are purely clerical, and entirely in the accountant-general&rsquo;s
department at the savings bank. Their leave is one
month per annum; their pension is on the ordinary civil service
scale. The examination is competitive; the subjects are handwriting
and spelling, arithmetic, English composition, geography,
English history, French or German. Candidates must be between
the ages of 18 and 20. Whether unmarried or widows they must
resign on marriage. The class of girl clerks take the same subjects
in a competitive examination. They must be between the ages of
16 and 18; they serve only in the Savings Bank department. If
competent they can pass on later to female clerkships. The salaries
of the female clerkships range from £200 to £500 in the higher
grade, £55 to £190 in the 2nd class, whilst girl clerks are paid from
£35 to £40, with the chance of advancement to higher posts.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;Civil service reform, like other great administrative
reforms, began in America in the latter half of the 19th
century. Personal and partisan government, with all the entailed
evils of the patronage system, culminated in Great Britain
during the reign of George III., and was one of the efficient
causes of the American revolution. Trevelyan characterizes the
use of patronage to influence legislation, and the giving of colonial
positions as sinecures to the privileged classes and personal
favourites of the administration, by saying, &ldquo;It was a system
which, as its one achievement of the first order, brought about
the American War, and made England sick, once and for all,
of the very name of personal government.&rdquo; It was natural that
the founders of the new government in America, after breaking
away from the mother-country, should strive to avoid the evils
which had in a measure brought about the revolution. Their
intention that the administrative officers of the government
should hold office during good behaviour is manifest, and was
given thorough and practical effect by every administration
during the first forty years of the life of the government. The
constitution fixed no term of office in the executive branch of
the government except those of president and vice-president;
and Madison, the expounder of the constitution, held that the
wanton removal of a meritorious officer was an impeachable
offence. Not until nine years after the passage of the Four Years&rsquo;
Tenure of Office Act in 1820 was there any material departure
from this traditional policy of the government. This act
(suggested by an appointing officer who wished to use the
power it gave in order to secure his own nomination for the
presidency, and passed without debate and apparently without
any adequate conception of its full effect) opened the doors of
the service to all the evils of the &ldquo;spoils system.&rdquo; The foremost
statesmen of the time were not slow to perceive the baleful
possibilities of this legislation, Jefferson,<a name="FnAnchor_1f" id="FnAnchor_1f" href="#Footnote_1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Webster, Clay, Calhoun,
Benton and many others being recorded as condemning and
deploring it in the strongest terms. The transition to the
&ldquo;spoils system&rdquo; was not, however, immediate, and for the next
nine years the practice of reappointing all meritorious officers
was practically universal; but in 1829 this practice ceased,
and the act of 1820 lent the sanction of law to the system of
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;spoils system&rdquo;.</span>
proscriptions which followed, which was a practical
application of the theory that &ldquo;to the victor belong
the spoils of the enemy.&rdquo; In 1836 the provisions of
this law, which had at first been confined mainly to
officers connected with the collection of revenue, were extended
to include also all postmasters receiving a compensation of $1000
per annum or more. It rapidly became the practice to regard all
these four years&rsquo; tenure offices as agencies not so much for the
transaction of the public business as for the advancement of
political ends. The revenue service from being used for political
purposes merely came to be used for corrupt purposes as well,
with the result that in one administration frauds were practised
upon the government to the extent of $75,000,000. The corrupting
influences permeated the whole body politic. Political retainers
were selected for appointment not on account of their
ability to do certain work but because they were followers of
certain politicians; these &ldquo;public servants&rdquo; acknowledged
no obligation except to those politicians, and their public duties,
if not entirely disregarded, were negligently and inefficiently
performed. Thus grew a saturnalia of spoils and corruption
which culminated in the assassination of a president.</p>

<p>Acute conditions, not theories, give rise to reforms. In
the congressional election of November 1882, following the
assassination of President Garfield as an incident in the operation
of the spoils system, the voice of the people commanding
reform was unmistakable. Congress assembled in December 1882,
and during the same month a bill looking to the improvement
of the civil service, which had been pending in the Senate for
nearly two years, was finally taken up and considered by that
body. In the debate upon this bill its advocates declared that
it would &ldquo;vastly improve the whole civil service of the country,&rdquo;
which they characterized as being at that time &ldquo;inefficient,
expensive and extravagant, and in many instances corrupt.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2f" id="FnAnchor_2f" href="#Footnote_2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">Law of 1883.</span>
This bill passed the Senate on the 27th of December
1882, and the House on the 4th of January 1883, and
was signed by the president on the 16th of January
1883, coming into full operation on the 16th of July 1883.
It is now the national civil service law. The fundamental principles
of this law are:&mdash;(1) selection by competitive examination
for all appointments to the &ldquo;classified service,&rdquo; with a
period of probationary service before absolute appointment;
(2) apportionment among the states and territories, according
to population, of all appointments in the departmental service
at Washington; (3) freedom of all the employees of the government
from any necessity to contribute to political campaign
funds or to render political services. For putting these principles
into effect the Civil Service Commission was created, and penalties
were imposed for the solicitation or collection from government
employees of contributions for political purposes, and for the
use of official positions in coercing political action. The commission,
in addition to its regular duties of aiding in the preparation
of civil service rules, of regulating and holding examinations,
and certifying the results thereof for use in making appointments,
and of keeping records of all changes in the service, was given
authority to investigate and report upon any violations of the
act or rules. The &ldquo;classified&rdquo; service to which the act applies
has grown, by the action of successive presidents in progressively
including various branches of tne service within it, from 13,924
positions in 1883 to some 80,000 (in round numbers) in 1900,
constituting about 40% of the entire civil service of the government
and including practically all positions above the grade of
mere labourer or workman to which appointment is <i>not</i> made
directly by the president with the consent of the Senate.<a name="FnAnchor_3f" id="FnAnchor_3f" href="#Footnote_3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a> A
very large class to which the act is expressly applicable, and
which has been partly brought within its provisions by executive
action, is that of fourth-class postmasters, of whom there are
between 70,000 and 80,000 (about 15,000 classified in 1909).</p>

<p>In order to provide registers of eligibles for the various grades
of positions in the classified service, the United States Civil
Service Commission holds annually throughout the country
about 300 different kinds of examinations. In the work of
preparing these examinations and of marking the papers of
competitors in them the commission is authorized by law
to avail itself, in addition to its own corps of trained men, of
the services of the scientific and other experts in the various
executive departments. In the work of holding the examinations
it is aided by about 1300 local boards of examiners, which
are its local representatives throughout the country and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
located at the principal post offices, custom houses and other
government offices, being composed of three or more Federal
employees in those offices. About 50,000 persons annually
compete in these examinations, and about 10,000 of those who
are successful receive appointments through regular certification.
Persons thus appointed, however, must serve six months &ldquo;on
probation&rdquo; before their appointment can be made absolute.
At the end of this probation, if his service has not been
satisfactory, the appointee is simply dropped; and the fact that less
than 1% of those appointed prove thus deficient on trial is high
testimony to the practical nature of the examinations held by
the commission, and to their aptness for securing persons qualified
for all classes of positions.</p>

<p>The effects of the Civil Service Act within the scope of its
actual operation have amply justified the hopes and promises of
its advocates. After its passage, absentee holders of lucrative
appointments were required to report for duty or to sever their
connexion with the service. Improved methods were adopted
in the departments, and superfluous and useless work was no
longer devised in order to provide a show of employment and a
<i>locus standi</i> for the parasites upon the public service. Individual
clerks were required, and by reason of the new conditions were
enabled, to do more and better work; and this, coupled with
the increase in efficiency in the service on account of new blood
coming in through the examinations, made possible an actual
decrease in the force required in many offices, notwithstanding
the natural growth in the amount of work to be done.<a name="FnAnchor_4f" id="FnAnchor_4f" href="#Footnote_4f"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
Experience proves that the desire to create new and unnecessary
positions was in direct proportion to the power to control them,
for where the act has taken away this power of control the desire
had disappeared naturally. There is no longer any desire on
the part of heads of departments to increase the number or
salaries of classified positions which would fall by law within the
civil service rules and be subject to competitive examinations.
Thus the promises of improvement and economy in the service
have been fulfilled.</p>

<p>The chief drawback to the full success of the act within its
intended scope of operation has been the withholding of
certain positions in the service from the application of the
vital principle of competition. The Civil Service Act contemplated
no exceptions, within the limits to which it was made
applicable, to the general principle of competition upon merit
for entrance to the service. In framing the first civil service
rules, however, in 1883, the president, yielding to the pressure
of the heads of some of the departments, and against the
urgent protest of the Civil Service Commission, excepted from
the requirement of examination large numbers of positions in the
higher grades of the service, chiefly fiduciary and administrative
positions such as cashiers, chief clerks and chiefs of division.
These positions being thus continued under the absolute control
of the appointing officer, the effect of their exception from
examination was to retain just that much of the old or &ldquo;spoils&rdquo;
system within the nominal jurisdiction of the new or &ldquo;merit&rdquo;
system. Even more: under the old system, while appointments
from the outside had been made regardless of fitness, still those
appointments had been made in the lower grades, the higher
positions being filled by promotion within the service, usually of
the most competent, but under the new system with its exceptions,
while appointments to the lower grades were filled on the basis of
merit, the pressure for spoils at each change of administration
forced inexperienced, political or personal favourites in at the top.
This blocked promotions and demoralized the service. Thus, while
the general effect of the act was to limit very greatly the number
of vicious appointments, at the same time the effect of these
exceptions was to confine them to the upper grades, where the
demoralizing effect of each upon the service would be a maximum.
By constant efforts the Civil Service Commission succeeded in
having position after position withdrawn from this excepted
class, until by the action of the president, on the 6th of May 1896,
it was finally reduced almost to a minimum. By subsequent
presidential action, however, on the 29th of May 1899, the
excepted class was again greatly extended.<a name="FnAnchor_5f" id="FnAnchor_5f" href="#Footnote_5f"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>A further obstacle to the complete success of the merit system,
and one which prevents the carrying forward of the reform to
the extent to which it has been carried in Great Britain, is
inherent in the Civil Service Act itself. All postmasters who
receive compensation of $1000 or more per annum, and all
collectors of customs and collectors of internal revenue, are
appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and
are therefore, by express provision of the act, not &ldquo;required
to be classified.&rdquo; The universal practice of treating these
offices as political agencies instead of as administrative business
offices is therefore not limited by the act. Such officers are
active in political work throughout the country, and their
official position adds greatly to their power to affect the political
prospects of the leaders in their districts. Accordingly the
Senate, from being, as originally intended, merely a confirming
body as to these officers, has become in a large measure, actually
if not formally, a nominating body, and holds with tenacity
to the power thus acquired by the individual senators. Thorough
civil service reform requires that these positions also, and all
those of fourth-class postmasters (partly classified by order of
1st Dec. 1908), be made subject to the merit system, for in
them is the real remaining stronghold of the spoils system. Even
though all their subordinates be appointed through examination,
it will be impossible to carry the reform to ultimate and complete
success so long as the officers in charge are appointed mainly
for political reasons and are changed with every change of
administration.</p>

<p>The purpose of the act to protect the individual employees
in the service from the rapacity of the &ldquo;political barons&rdquo; has
been measurably, if not completely, successful. The power
given the Civil Service Commission, to investigate and report
upon violations of the law, has been used to bring to light such
abuses as the levying of political contributions, and to set the
machinery of the law in motion against them. While comparatively
few actual prosecutions have been brought about, and
although the penalties imposed by the act for this offence have
been but seldom inflicted, still the publicity given to all such
cases by the commission&rsquo;s investigations has had a wholesome
deterrent effect. Before the passage of the act, positions were
as a general rule held upon a well-understood lease-tenure, the
political contributions for them being as securely and as certainly
collected as any rent. Now, however, it can be said that these
forced contributions have almost entirely disappeared. The
efforts which are still made to collect political funds from government
employees in evasion of the law are limited in the main
to persuasion to make &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; contributions, and it has
been possible so to limit and obstruct these efforts that their
practical effect upon the character of the service is now very
small.</p>

<p>The same evils that the Federal Civil Service Act was designed
to remedy exist to a large degree in many of the state governments,
and are especially aggravated in the administration
of the local governments of some of the larger
<span class="sidenote">State examination.</span>
cities. The chief, if not the only, test of fitness for
office in many cases has been <span class="correction" title="amended from partly">party</span> loyalty, honesty
and capacity being seldom more than secondary considerations.
The result has been the fostering of dishonesty and extravagance,
which have brought weakness and gross corruption into the
administration of the local governments. In consequence of
this there has been a constantly growing tendency, among the
more intelligent class of citizens, to demand that honest business
methods be applied to local public service, and that appointments
be made on the basis of intelligence and capacity, rather than
of party allegiance. The movement for the reform of the civil
service of cities is going hand in hand with the movement for
general municipal reform, those reformers regarding the merit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
system of appointments as not merely the necessary and only
safe bulwark to preserve the results of their labours, but also as
the most efficient means for bringing about other reforms.
Hence civil service reform is given a leading position in all
programmes for the reform of state and municipal governments.
This has undoubtedly been due, in the first instance, at least, to
the success which attended the application of the merit system
to the Federal service, municipal and state legislation following
in the wake of the national civil service law. In New York an act
similar to the Federal Civil Service Act was passed on the 4th
of May 1883, and in 1894 the principles of the merit system
were introduced by an amendment into the state constitution,
and made applicable to cities and villages as well. In Massachusetts
an act was passed on the 3rd of June 1884 which in
its general features was based upon the Federal act and the
New York act. Similar laws were passed in Illinois and Wisconsin
in 1895, and in New Jersey in 1908; the laws provide for the
adoption of the merit system in state and municipal government.
In New Orleans, La., and in Seattle, Wash., the merit
system was introduced by an amendment to the city charter
in 1896. The same result was accomplished by New Haven,
Conn., in 1897, and by San Francisco, Cal., in 1899. In still
other cities the principles of the merit system have been enacted
into law, in some cases applying to the entire service and in
others to only a part of it.</p>

<p>The application of the merit system to state and municipal
governments has proved successful wherever it has been given
a fair trial.<a name="FnAnchor_6f" id="FnAnchor_6f" href="#Footnote_6f"><span class="sp">6</span></a> As experience has fostered public confidence in the
system, and at the same time shown those features of the law
which are most vulnerable, and the best means for fortifying
them, numerous and important improvements upon the pioneer
act applying to the Federal service have been introduced in
the more recent legislation. This is particularly true of the acts
now in force in New York (passed in 1899) and in Chicago.
The power of the commission to enforce these acts is materially
greater than the power possessed by the Federal commission.
In making investigations they are not confined to taking the
testimony of voluntary witnesses, but may administer oaths,
and compel testimony and the production of books and papers
where necessary; and in taking action they are not confined
to the making of a report of the findings in their investigations,
but may themselves, in many cases, take final judicial action.
Further than this, the payment of salaries is made dependent
upon the certificate of the commission that the appointments
of the recipients were made in accordance with the civil service
law and rules. Thus these commissions have absolute power
to prevent irregular or illegal appointments by refractory
appointing officers. Their powers being so much greater than
those of the national commission, their action can be much
more drastic in most cases, and they can go more directly to the
heart of an existing abuse, and apply more quickly and effectually
the needed remedy.</p>

<p>Upon the termination of the Spanish-American War, the
necessity for the extension of the principles of the merit system
to the new territories, the responsibility for whose government
the results of this war had thrown upon the United States, was
realized. By the acts providing for civil government in Porto
Rico (April 12th, 1900) and Hawaii (April 30th, 1900), the
provisions of the Civil Service Act and Rules were applied to
those islands. Under this legislation the classification applies
to all positions which are analogous to positions in the Federal
service, those which correspond to positions in the municipal
and state governments being considered as local in character,
and not included in the classification.</p>

<p>On the 19th of September 1900 the United States Philippine
Commission passed an act &ldquo;for the establishment and maintenance
of an efficient and honest civil service in the Philippine
Islands.&rdquo; This act, in its general features, is based upon the
national civil service law, but includes also a number of the
stronger points to be found in the state and municipal law
mentioned above. Among these are the power given the civil
service board to administer oaths, summon witnesses, and require
the production of official records; and the power to stop payment
of salaries to persons illegally appointed. Promotions are
determined by competitive examinations, and are made throughout
the service, as there are no excepted positions. A just
right of preference in local appointments is given to natives.
The president of the Philippine commission in introducing this
bill said: &ldquo;The purpose of the United States government ...
in these islands is to secure for the Filipino people as honest
and as efficient a government as may be possible.... It is the
hope of the commission to make it possible for one entering the
lowest ranks to reach the highest, under a tenure based solely
upon merit.&rdquo; Judging by past experience it is believed that
this law is well adapted to accomplish the purpose above stated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For fuller information upon the details of the present workings
of the merit system in the Federal service, recourse should be had
to the publications of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, which are
to be found in the public libraries in all the principal cities in the
United States, or which may be had free of charge upon application
to the commission. The <i>Manual of Examinations</i>, published semi-annually,
gives full information as to the character of the examinations
held by the commission, together with the schedule of dates
and places for the holding of those examinations. The <i>Annual
Reports</i> of the commission contain full statistics of the results of its
work, together with comprehensive statements as to the difficulties
encountered in enforcing the law, and the means used to overcome
them. In the <i>Fifteenth Report</i>, pp. 443-485, will be found a very
valuable historical compilation from original sources, upon the
&ldquo;practice of the presidents in appointments and removals in the
executive civil service, from 1789 to 1883.&rdquo; In the same report,
pp. 511-517, is a somewhat comprehensive bibliography of &ldquo;civil
service&rdquo; in periodical literature in the 19th century, brought down
to the end of 1898. See also C.R. Fish, <i>The Civil Service and the
Patronage</i> (New York, 1905).</p>

<p>In most European countries the civil service is recruited on much
the same lines as in the United Kingdom and the United States,
that is, either by examination or by nomination or by both. In
some cases the examination is purely competitive, in other cases,
as in France, holders of university degrees get special privileges, such
as being put at the head of the list, or going up a certain number of
places; or, as in Germany, many departmental posts are filled by
nomination, combined with the results of general examinations,
either at school or university. In the publications of the United
States Department of Labour and Commerce for 1904-1905 will
be found brief details of the systems adopted by the various foreign
countries for appointing their civil service employees.</p>

in the province of Rome, 50 m. N.W. by rail and 35 m. direct
from the city of Rome. Pop. (1871) 8143; (1901) 17,589. It
is the ancient <i>Centum Cellae</i>, founded by Trajan. Interesting
descriptions of it are given by Pliny the Younger (<i>Epist.</i> vi. 31)
and Rutilius Namat. i. 237. The modern harbour works rest
on the ancient foundations, and near it the cemetery of detachments
of the <i>Classes Misenensis</i> and <i>Ravennas</i> has been found
(<i>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</i> vol. xi., Berlin, 1888, pp. 3520 seq.). Remains
of an aqueduct and other Roman buildings are preserved; the
imperial family had a villa here. Procopius mentions it in the
6th century as a strong and populous place, but it was destroyed
in 813 by the Saracens. Leo IV. erected a new city for the
inhabitants on the site where they had taken refuge, about 8 m.
N.N.E. of Civita Vecchia towards the hills, near La Farnesina,
where its ruins may still be seen; the city walls and some of
the streets and buildings may be traced, and an inscription
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
(which must have stood over one of the city gates) recording
its foundation has been discovered. It continued to exist under
the name Cencelle as a feudal castle until the 15th century.
In the meantime, however, the inhabitants returned to the old
town by the shore in 889 and rebuilt it, giving it the name
Civitas Vetus, the modern Civita Vecchia (see O. Marucchi in
<i>Nuovo Bullettino di archeologia cristiana</i>, vi., 1900, p. 195 seq.).
In 1508 Pope Julius II. began the construction of the castle
from the designs of Bramante, Michelangelo being responsible
for the addition of the central tower. It is considered by Burckhardt
the finest building of its kind. Pius IV. added a convict
prison. The arsenal was built by Alexander VII. and designed
by Bernini. Civita Vecchia was the chief port of the Papal
State and has still a considerable trade. There are cement
factories in the town, and calcium carbide is an important article
of export. The principal imports are coal, cattle for the home
markets, and fire-bricks from the United Kingdom. Three
miles N.E. were the <i>Aquae Tauri</i>, warm springs, now known
as <i>Bagni della Ferrata</i>: considerable remains of the Roman
baths are still preserved. About 1 m. W. of these are other
hot springs, those of the <i>Ficoncella</i>, also known in Roman times.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLACKMANNAN<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span>, the county town of Clackmannanshire,
Scotland. Pop. 1505. It lies near the north bank of the Forth,
2 m. E. of Alloa, with two stations on the North British railway.
Among the public buildings are the parish church, the tower of
which, standing on a commanding eminence, is a conspicuous
landmark. Clackmannan Tower is now a picturesque ruin,
but at one time played an important part in Scottish history,
and was the seat of a lineal descendant of the Bruce family
after the failure of the male line. The old market cross still
exists, and close to it stands the stone that gives the town its
name (Gaelic, <i>clach</i>, stone; Manann, the name of the district).
A large spinning-mill and coalpits lend a modern touch in
singular contrast with the quaint, old-world aspect of the place.
About 1 m. to the S.E. is Kennet House, the seat of Lord Balfour
of Burleigh, another member of the Bruce family.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLACKMANNANSHIRE<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span>, the smallest county in Scotland,
bounded S.W. by the Forth, W. by Stirlingshire, N.N.E. and
N.W. by Perthshire, and E. by Fifeshire. It has an area of
35,160 acres, or about 55 sq. m. An elevated ridge starting on
the west, runs through the middle of the county, widening
gradually till it reaches the eastern boundary, and skirting
the alluvial or carse lands in the valleys of the Forth and Devon.
Still farther to the N. the Ochil hills form a picturesque feature
in the landscape, having their generally verdant surface broken
by bold projecting rocks and deeply indented ravines. The
principal summits are within the limits of the shire, among
them Ben Cleuch (2363 ft.), King&rsquo;s Seat (2111 ft.), Whitewisp
(2110 ft.), the Law (above Tillicoultry, 2094 ft.) and Blairdenon
(2072 ft.), on the northern slope, in which the river Devon takes
its rise. The rivers of importance are the Devon and the Black
or South Devon. The former, noted in the upper parts for its
romantic scenery and its excellent trout-fishing, runs through the
county near the base of the Ochils, and falls into the Forth at
the village of Cambus, after a winding course of 33 m., although
as the crow flies its source is only 5&frac14; m. distant. The Black
Devon, rising in the Cleish Hills, flows westwards in a direction
nearly parallel to that of the Devon, and falls into the Forth
near Clackmannan. It supplies motive power to numbers of
mills and collieries; and its whole course is over coal strata.
The Forth is navigable as far as it forms the boundary of the
county, and ships of 500 tons burden run up as far as Alloa.
The only lake is Gartmorn, 1 m. long by about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of a mile broad,
which has been dammed in order to furnish water to Alloa and
power to mills. The Ochils are noted for the number of their
glens. Though these are mostly small, they are well wooded
and picturesque, and those at Menstrie, Alva, Tillicoultry and
Dollar are particularly beautiful.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;This county is divided geologically into two areas, the
boundary line skirting the southern margin of the Ochils and running
westwards from a point north of Dollar by Alva in the direction of
Airthrev in Stirlingshire. The northern portion forms part of the
volcanic range of the Ochils which belongs to the Old Red Sandstone
period, and consists of a great succession of lavas&mdash;basalts and
andesites&mdash;with intercalations of tuff and agglomerate. As the
rocks dip gently towards the north and form the highest ground
in the county they must reach a great thickness. They are pierced
by small intrusive masses of diorite, north of Tillicoultry House.
The well-marked feature running E. and W. along the southern
base of the Ochils indicates a line of fault or dislocation which
abruptly truncates the Lower Old Red volcanic rocks and brings
down an important development of Carboniferous strata occupying
the southern part of the county. These belong mainly to the Coal-measures
and comprise a number of valuable coal-seams which
have been extensively worked. The Clackmannan field is the
northern continuation of the great Lanarkshire basin which extends
northwards by Slamannan, Falkirk and the Carron Ironworks to
Alloa. Along the eastern margin between Cairnmuir and Brucefield
the underlying Millstone Grit, consisting mainly of false-bedded
sandstones, comes to the surface. Close to the river Devon
south of Dollar the Vicars Bridge Limestone, which there marks the
top of the Carboniferous Limestone series, rises from beneath the
Millstone Grit. The structure of the Clackmannan field is interesting.
The strata are arranged in synclinal form, the highest seams being
found near the Devon ironworks, and they are traversed by a series
of parallel east and west faults each with a downthrow to the south,
whereby the coals are repeated and the field extended. During
mining operations evidence has been obtained of the existence of
a buried river-channel, filled with boulder clay and stratified deposits
along the course of the Devon, which extends below the
present sea-level and points to greater elevation of the land in
pre-glacial time. An excellent example of a dolerite dyke trending
slightly north of west occurs in the north part of the county where
it traverses the volcanic rocks of Lower Old Red Sandstone age.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The soil is generally productive and well cultivated,
though the greater part of the elevated range which is
interposed between the carse lands on the Forth and the vale
of Devon at the base of the Ochils on the north consists of inferior
soils, often lying upon an impervious clay. Oats are the chief
crop, but wheat and barley are profitably grown. Sheep-farming
is successfully pursued, the Ochils affording excellent
pasturage, and cattle, pigs and horses are also raised. There is
a small tract of moorland in the east, called the Forest, bounded
on its northern margin by the Black Devon. Iron-ore (haematite),
copper, silver, lead, cobalt and arsenic have all been
discovered in small quantity in the Ochils, between Alva and
Dollar. Ironstone&mdash;found either in beds, or in oblate balls
embedded in slaty clay, and yielded from 25 to 30% of iron&mdash;is
mined for the Devon iron-works, near Clackmannan. Coal
has been mined for a long period. The strata which compose the
field are varieties of sandstone, shale, fire-clay and argillaceous
ironstone. There is a heavy continuous output of coal at the
mines at Sauchie, Fishcross, Coalsnaughton, Devonside, Clackmannan
and other pits. The spinning-mills at Alloa, Tillicoultry
and Alva are always busy, Alloa yarns and fingering being widely
famous. The distilleries at Glenochil and Carsebridge and the
breweries in Alloa and Cambus do a large export business.
The minor trades include glass-blowing, pottery, coopering,
tanning, iron-founding, electrical apparatus making, ship-building
and paper-making.</p>

<p>The north British railway serves the whole county, while the
Caledonian has access to Alloa.</p>

<p><i>Population and Government.</i>&mdash;The population was 33,140
in 1891 and 32,029 in 1901, when 170 persons spoke Gaelic and
English and one person Gaelic only. The county unites with
Kinross-shire in returning one member to parliament. Clackmannan
(pop. 1505) is the county town, but Alloa (14,458),
Alva (4624), and Tillicoultry (3338) take precedence in population
and trade. Menstrie (pop. 898) near Alloa has a large
furniture factory and the great distillery of Glenochil. To the
north-east of Alloa is the thriving mining village of Sauchie.
Clackmannan forms a sheriffdom with Stirling and Dumbarton
shires, and a sheriff-substitute sits at Alloa. Most of the schools
in the shire are under school-board control, but there are a
few voluntary schools, besides an exceptionally well-equipped
technical school in Alloa and a well-known academy at Dollar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLADEL, LÉON<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1835-1892), French novelist, was born at
Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne) on the 13th of March 1835.
The son of an artisan, he studied law at Toulouse and became
a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk in Paris. He made a reputation in a limited
circle by his first book, <i>Les Martyrs ridicules</i> (1862), a novel for
which Charles Baudelaire, whose literary disciple Cladel was,
wrote a preface. He then returned to his native district of
Quercy, where he produced a series of pictures of peasant life in
<i>Eral le dompteur</i> (1865), <i>Le Nommé Qouael</i> (1868) and other
volumes. Returning to Paris he published the two novels
which are generally acknowledged as his best work, <i>Le Bouscassié</i>
(1869) and <i>La Fête votive de Saint Bartholomée Porte-glaive</i> (1872).
<i>Une Maudite</i> (1876) was judged dangerous to the public morals
and cost its author a month&rsquo;s imprisonment. Other works by
Cladel are <i>Les Va-nu-pieds</i> (1873), a volume of short stories;
<i>N&rsquo;a qu&rsquo;un &oelig;il</i> (1882), <i>Urbains et ruraux</i> (1884), <i>Gueux de

<p><span class="bold">CLAFLIN, HORACE BRIGHAM<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1811-1885), American
merchant, was born in Milford, Massachusetts, on the 18th of
December 1811. He was educated at Milford Academy, became
a clerk in his father&rsquo;s store in Milford, and in 1831, with his
brother Aaron and his brother-in-law Samuel Daniels, succeeded
to his father&rsquo;s business. In 1832 the firm opened a branch store
in Worcester, Mass., and in 1833 Horace B. Claflin and Daniels
secured the sole control of this establishment and restricted their
dealing to dry goods. In 1843 Claflin removed to New York
City and became a member of the firm of Bulkley &amp; Claflin,
wholesale dry goods merchants. In 1851 and in 1864 the firm
was reorganized, being designated in these respective years
as Claflin, Mellin &amp; Company and H.B. Claflin &amp; Company.
Under Claflin&rsquo;s management the business increased so rapidly
that the sales for a time after 1865 probably exceeded those
of any other mercantile house in the world. Though the firm
was temporarily embarrassed at the beginning of the Civil War,
on account of its large business interests in the South, and during
the financial panic of 1873, the promptness with which Mr
Claflin met these crises and paid every dollar of his liabilities
greatly increased his reputation for business ability and integrity.
He died at Fordham, New York, on the 14th of November 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAIRAULT<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Clairaut</span>), <span class="bold">ALEXIS CLAUDE</span> (1713-1765),
French mathematician, was born on the 13th or 7th of May 1713,
at Paris, where his father was a teacher of mathematics. Under
his father&rsquo;s tuition he made such rapid progress in mathematical
studies that in his thirteenth year he read before the French
Academy an account of the properties of four curves which he
had then discovered. When only sixteen he finished a treatise,
<i>Recherches sur les courbes à double courbure</i>, which, on its
publication in 1731, procured his admission into the Academy of
Sciences, although even then he was below the legal age. In
1736, together with Pierre Louis Maupertuis, he took part in the
expedition to Lapland, which was undertaken for the purpose
of estimating a degree of the meridian, and on his return he
published his treatise <i>Théorie de la figure de la terre</i> (1743). In
this work he promulgated the theorem, known as &ldquo;Clairault&rsquo;s
theorem,&rdquo; which connects the gravity at points on the surface
of a rotating ellipsoid with the compression and the centrifugal
force at the equator (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Earth, Figure of the</a></span>). He obtained
an ingenious approximate solution of the problem of the three
bodies; in 1750 he gained the prize of the St Petersburg Academy
for his essay <i>Théorie de la lune</i>; and in 1759 he calculated the
perihelion of Halley&rsquo;s comet. He also detected singular solutions
in differential equations of the first order, and of the second and
higher degrees.    Clairault died at Paris, on the 17th of May 1765.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAIRON, LA<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> (1723-1803), French actress, whose real name
was <span class="sc">Claire Joseph Hippolyte Leris</span>, was born at Condé sur
l&rsquo;Escaut, Hainaut, on the 25th of January 1723, the natural
daughter of <span class="correction" title="amended from any">an</span> army sergeant. In 1736 she made her first stage
appearance at the Comédie Italienne, in a small part in Marivaux&rsquo;s
<i>Île des esclaves</i>. After several years in the provinces she returned
to Paris. Her life, meanwhile, had been decidedly irregular,
even if not to the degree indicated by the libellous pamphlet
<i>Histoire de la demoiselle Cronel, dite Frétillon, actrice de la Comédie
de Rouen, écrite par elle-même</i> (The Hague, 1746), or to be inferred
from the disingenuousness of her own <i>Mémoires d&rsquo;Hippolyte
Clairon</i> (1798); and she had great difficulty in obtaining an
order to make her <i>début</i> at the Comédie Française. Succeeding,
however, at last, she had the courage to select the title-rôle of
<i>Phèdre</i> (1743), and she obtained a veritable triumph. During
her twenty-two years at this theatre, dividing the honours
with her rival Mlle Dumesnil, she filled many of the classical
rôles of tragedy, and created a great number of parts in the plays
of Voltaire, Marmontel, Saurin, de Belloy and others. She
retired in 1766, and trained pupils for the stage, among them
Mlle Raucourt. Goldsmith called Mlle Clairon &ldquo;the most perfect
female figure I have ever seen on any stage&rdquo; (<i>The Bee</i>, 2nd No.);
and Garrick, while recognizing her unwillingness or inability
to make use of the inspiration of the instant, admitted that
&ldquo;she has everything that art and a good understanding with
great natural spirit can give her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAIRVAUX<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span>, a village of north-eastern France, in the department
of Aube, 40 m. E.S.E. of Troyes on the Eastern railway to
Belfort. Clairvaux (<i>Clara Vallis</i>) is situated in the valley of the
Aube on the eastern border of the Forest of Clairvaux. Its
celebrity is due to the abbey founded in 1115 by St Bernard,
which became the centre of the Cistercian order. The buildings
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abbey</a></span>) belong for the most part to the 18th century, but
there is a large storehouse which dates from the 12th century.
The abbey, suppressed at the Revolution, now serves as a prison,
containing on an average 800 inmates, who are employed in
agricultural and industrial occupations. Clairvaux has iron-works
of some importance.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAIRVOYANCE<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (Fr. for &ldquo;clear-seeing&rdquo;), a technical term in
psychical research, properly equivalent to lucidity, a supernormal
power of obtaining knowledge in which no part is played
by (<i>a</i>) the ordinary processes of sense-perception or (<i>b</i>) supernormal
communication with other intelligences, incarnate, or
discarnate. The word is also used, sometimes qualified by the
word <i>telepathic</i>, to mean the power of gaining supernormal
knowledge from the mind of another (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telepathy</a></span>). It is
further commonly used by spiritualists to mean the power of
seeing spirit forms, or, more vaguely, of discovering facts by some
supernormal means.</p>

<p><i>Lucidity.</i>&mdash;Few experiments have been made to test the
existence of this faculty. If communications from discarnate
minds are regarded as possible, there are no means of distinguishing
facts obtained in this way from facts obtained by independent
clairvoyance. In practice no evidence has been obtained
pointing to the possession by a discarnate spirit of knowledge not
possessed by any living person (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Medium</a></span>). As explanation of
the few successful experiments in independent clairvoyance we
have the choice of three explanations: (1) lucidity; (2) telepathy
from living persons; (3) hyperaesthesia. The second possibility
was overlooked in Richet&rsquo;s diagram experiments; it cannot be
assumed that a picture put into an envelope and not consciously
recalled has been in reality forgotten. Similarly the clairvoyant
diagnosis of diseases may depend on knowledge gained telepathically
from the patient, who may be subliminally aware of
diseased states of the body. The most elaborate experiments are
by Prof. Richet with a hypnotized subject who succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
naming twelve cards out of sixty-eight. But no precautions were
taken against hyperaesthesia further than enclosing the card in a
second envelope. There is a power possessed by a certain number
of people, of naming a card drawn by them or held in the hand
face downwards, so that there is no normal knowledge of its suit
and number. Few thorough trials have been made; but it seems
to point to some kind of hyperaesthesia rather than to clairvoyance;
in the Richet experiments even if the envelopes
excluded hyperaesthesia of touch on the part of the medium,
there may have been subliminal knowledge on Prof. Richet&rsquo;s
part of the card which he put in the envelope. The experience
known as the <i>déjà vu</i> has sometimes been explained as due to
clairvoyance.</p>

<p><i>Telepathic Clairvoyance.</i>&mdash;For a discussion of this see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telepathy</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crystal-gazing</a></span>. It may be noted here that some
curious relation seems to exist between apparently telepathic
acquisition of knowledge and the arrival of a letter, newspaper,
&amp;c, from which the same knowledge could be directly gained.
We are confronted with a similar problem in attempting an
explanation of the power of mediums to state correctly facts
relating to objects placed in their hands. Of a somewhat
different character is retrocognition (<i>q.v.</i>), where the knowledge in
many cases, if telepathic, must be derived from a discarnate mind.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance, as a term of spiritualism, with its correlative
<i>clairaudience</i>, is the name given to the power of seeing and hearing
discarnate spirits of dead relatives and others, with whom the
living are said to be surrounded. More vaguely it includes the
power of gaining knowledge, either through the spirit world or by
means of psychometry (<i>i.e.</i> the supernormal acquisition of
knowledge about owners of objects, writers of letters, &amp;c).
Some evidence for these latter powers has been accumulated by
the Society for Psychical Research, but in many cases the
piecing together of normally acquired knowledge, together with
shrewd guessing, suffices to explain the facts, especially where the
investigator has had no special training for his task.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAMECY<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span>, a town of central France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Nièvre, at the confluence of the Yonne
and Beuvron and on the Canal du Nivernais, 46 m. N.N.E. of
Nevers on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) 4455. Its
principal building is the church of St Martin, which dates chiefly
from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. The tower and façade
are of the 16th century. The chevet, which is surrounded by an
aisle, is rectangular&mdash;a feature found in few French churches.
Of the old castle of the counts of Nevers, vaulted cellars alone
remain. A church in the suburb of Bethlehem, dating from the
12th and 13th centuries, now serves as part of an hotel. The
public institutions include the sub-prefecture, tribunals of first
instance and of commerce and a communal college. Among the
industrial establishments are saw-mills, fulling-mills and flour-mills,
tanneries and manufactories of boots and shoes and
chemicals; and there is considerable trade in wine and cattle and
in wood and charcoal, which is conveyed principally to Paris, by
way of the Yonne.</p>

<p>In the early middle ages Clamecy belonged to the abbey of St
Julian at Auxerre; in the 11th century it passed to the counts of
Nevers, one of whom, Hervé, enfranchised the inhabitants in
1213. After the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1188,
Clamecy became the seat of the bishops of Bethlehem, who till the
Revolution resided in the hospital of Panthenor, bequeathed by
William IV., count of Nevers. On the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851 an
insurrection broke out in the town, and was repressed by the new
authorities with great severity.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAN<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (Gaelic <i>clann</i>, O. Ir. <i>cland</i>, connected with Lat. <i>planta</i>,
shoot or scion, the ancient Gaelic or Goidelic substituting k for p),
a group of people united by common blood, and usually settled in
a common habitat. The clan system existed in Ireland and the
Highlands of Scotland from early times. In its strictest sense the
system was peculiar to those countries, but, in its wider meaning
of a group of kinsmen forming a self-governing community, the
system as represented by the village community has been shown
by Sir H. Maine and others to have existed at one time or
another in all lands.</p>

<p>Before the use of surnames and elaborate written genealogies,
a tribe in its definite sense was called in Celtic a <i>tuath</i>, a word
of wide affinities, from a root <i>tu</i>, to grow, to multiply, existing
in all European languages. When the tribal system began to
be broken up by conquest and by the rise of towns and of territorial
government, the use of a common surname furnished a
new bond for keeping up a connexion between kindred. The
head of a tribe or smaller group of kindred selected some ancestor
and called himself his <i>Ua</i>, grandson, or as it has been anglicized
<i>O&rsquo;, e.g. Ua Conchobair</i> (O&rsquo; Conor), <i>Ua Suilleabhain</i> (O&rsquo;Sullivan).
All his kindred adopted the same name, the chief using no
fore-name however. The usual mode of distinguishing a person
before the introduction of surnames was to name his father and
grandfather, <i>e.g.</i> Owen, son of Donal, son of Dermot. This
naturally led some to form their surnames with <i>Mac</i>, son, instead
of <i>Ua</i>, grandson, <i>e.g.</i> <i>MacCarthaigh</i>, son of <i>Carthach</i> (MacCarthy),
<i>MacRuaidhri</i>, son of Rory (Macrory). Both methods have been
followed in Ireland, but in Scotland <i>Mac</i> came to be exclusively
used. The adoption of such genealogical surnames fostered the
notion that all who bore the same surname were kinsmen, and
hence the genealogical term <i>clann</i>, which properly means the
descendants of some progenitor, gradually became synonymous
with <i>tuath</i>, tribe. Like all purely genealogical terms, <i>clann</i> may
be used in the limited sense of a particular tribe governed by a
chief, or in that of many tribes claiming descent from a common
ancestor. In the latter sense it was synonymous with <i>síl, siol,</i>
seed <i>e.g.</i> <i>Siol Alpine</i>, a great clan which included the smaller
clans of the Macgregors, Grants, Mackinnons, Macnabs, Macphies,
Macquarries and Macaulays.</p>

<p>The clan system in the most archaic form of which we have
any definite information can be best studied in the Irish <i>tuath</i>,
or tribe.<a name="FnAnchor_1g" id="FnAnchor_1g" href="#Footnote_1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> This consisted of two classes: (1) tribesmen, and
(2) a miscellaneous class of slaves, criminals, strangers and their
descendants. The first class included tribesmen by blood in the
male line, including all illegitimate children acknowledged by
their fathers, and tribesmen by adoption or sons of tribeswomen
by strangers, foster-sons, men who had done some signal service
to the tribe, and lastly the descendants of the second class after
a certain number of generations. Each <i>tuath</i> had a chief called
a <i>ríg</i>, king, a word cognate with the Gaulish <i>ríg-s</i> or <i>rix</i>, the
Latin <i>reg-s</i> or <i>rex</i>, and the Old Norse <i>rik-ir</i>. The tribesmen
formed a number of communities, each of which, like the tribe
itself, consisted of a head, <i>ceann fine</i>, his kinsmen, slaves and
other retainers. This was the <i>fine</i>, or sept. Each of these
occupied a certain part of the tribe-land, the arable part being
cultivated under a system of co-tillage, the pasture land co-grazed
according to certain customs, and the wood, bog and
mountains forming the marchland of the sept being the unrestricted
common land of the sept. The sept was in fact a
village community.</p>

<p>What the sept was to the tribe, the homestead was to the sept.
The head of a homestead was an <i>aire</i>, a representative freeman
capable of acting as a witness, compurgator and bail. These
were very important functions, especially when it is borne in
mind that the tribal homestead was the home of many of the
kinsfolk of the head of the family as well as of his own children.
The descent of property being according to a gavel-kind custom,
it constantly happened that when an <i>aire</i> died the share of his
property which each member of his immediate family was entitled
to receive was not sufficient to qualify him to be an <i>aire</i>.
In this case the family did not divide the inheritance, but
remained together as &ldquo;a joint and undivided family,&rdquo; one of the
members being elected chief of the family or household, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
this capacity enjoyed the rights and privileges of an <i>aire</i>. Sir
H.S. Maine directed attention to this kind of family as an
important feature of the early institutions of all Indo-European
nations. Beside the &ldquo;joint and undivided family,&rdquo; there was
another kind of family which we might call &ldquo;the joint family.&rdquo;
This was a partnership composed of three or four members of a
sept whose individual wealth was not sufficient to qualify each
of them to be an <i>aire</i>, but whose joint wealth qualified one of the
co-partners as head of the joint family to be one.</p>

<p>So long as there was abundance of land each family grazed
its cattle upon the tribe-land without restriction; unequal
increase of wealth and growth of population naturally led to its
limitation, each head of a homestead being entitled to graze
an amount of stock in proportion to his wealth, the size of his
homestead, and his acquired position. The arable land was no
doubt applotted annually at first; gradually, however, some
of the richer families of the tribe succeeded in evading this
exchange of allotments and converting part of the common land
into an estate in sevralty. Septs were at first colonies of the
tribe which settled on the march-land; afterwards the conversion
of part of the common land into an estate in sevralty enabled
the family that acquired it to become the parent of a new sept.
The same process might, however, take place within a sept
without dividing it; in other words, several members of the
sept might hold part of the land of the sept as separate estate.
The possession of land in sevralty introduced an important
distinction into the tribal system&mdash;it created an aristocracy.
An <i>aire</i> whose family held the same land for three generations
was called a <i>flaith</i>, or lord, of which rank there were several
grades according to their wealth in land and chattels. The <i>aires</i>
whose wealth consisted in cattle only were called <i>bó-aires</i>, or
cow-<i>aires</i>, of whom there were also several grades, depending
on their wealth in stock. When a <i>bó-aire</i> had twice the wealth
of the lowest class of <i>flaith</i> he might enclose part of the land
adjoining his house as a lawn; this was the first step towards
his becoming a <i>flaith</i>. The relations which subsisted between
the <i>flaiths</i> and the <i>bó-aires</i> formed the most curious part of the
Celtic tribal system, and throw a flood of light on the origin
of the feudal system. Every tribesman without exception owed
<i>ceilsinne</i> to the <i>ríg</i>, or chief, that is, he was bound to become
his <i>ceile</i>, or vassal. This consisted in paying the <i>ríg</i> a tribute
in kind, for which the <i>ceile</i> was entitled to receive a proportionate
amount of stock without having to give any bond for their
return, giving him service, <i>e.g.</i> in building his <i>dun</i>, or stronghold,
reaping his harvest, keeping his roads clean and in repair, killing
wolves, and especially service in the field, and doing him homage
three times while seated every time he made his return of tribute.
Paying the &ldquo;<i>calpe</i>&rdquo; to the Highland chiefs represented this
kind of vassalage, a <i>colpdach</i> or heifer being in many cases the
amount of food-rent paid by a free or <i>saer ceile</i>. A tribesman
might, however, if he pleased, pay a higher rent on receiving
more stock together with certain other chattels for which no
rent was chargeable. In this case he entered into a contract,
and was therefore a bond or <i>daer ceile</i>. No one need have
accepted stock on these terms, nor could he do so without the
consent of his sept, and he might free himself at any time from
his obligation by returning what he had received, and the rent
due thereon.</p>

<p>What every one was bound to do to his <i>ríg</i>, or chief, he might
do voluntarily to the <i>flaith</i> of his sept, to any <i>flaith</i> of the tribe,
or even to one of another tribe. He might also become a bond
<i>ceile</i>. In either case he might renounce his ceileship by returning
a greater or lesser amount of stock than what he had received
according to the circumstances under which he terminated his
vassalage. In cases of disputed succession to the chiefship of a
tribe the rival claimants were always anxious to get as many
as possible to become their vassals. Hence the anxiety of minor
chieftains, in later times in the Highlands of Scotland, to induce
the clansmen to pay the &ldquo;<i>calpe</i>&rdquo; where there happened to be a
doubt as to who was entitled to be chief.</p>

<p>The effect of the custom of gavel-kind was to equalize the
wealth of each and leave no one wealthy enough to be chief.
The &ldquo;joint and undivided family&rdquo; and the formation of &ldquo;joint
families,&rdquo; or gilds, was one way of obviating this result; another
way was the custom of tanistry. The headship of the tribe was
practically confined to the members of one family; this was
also the case with the headship of a sept. Sometimes a son
succeeded his father, but the rule was that the eldest and most
capable member of the <i>geilfine</i>, that is, the relatives of the actual
chief to the fifth degree,<a name="FnAnchor_2g" id="FnAnchor_2g" href="#Footnote_2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> was selected during his lifetime to be
his successor&mdash;generally the eldest surviving brother or son of
the preceding chief. The man selected as successor to a chief
of a tribe, or chieftain of a sept, was called the tanist, and
should be &ldquo;the most experienced, the most noble, the most
wealthy, the wisest, the most learned, the most truly popular,
the most powerful to oppose, the most steadfast to sue for
profits and (be sued) for losses.&rdquo; In addition to these qualities
he should be free from personal blemishes and deformities and
of fit age to lead his tribe or sept, as the case may be, to battle.<a name="FnAnchor_3g" id="FnAnchor_3g" href="#Footnote_3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
So far as selecting the man of the <i>geilfine</i> who was supposed to
possess all those qualities, the office of chief of a tribe or chieftain
of a sept was elective, but as the <i>geilfine</i> was represented by four
persons, together with the chief or chieftain, the election was
practically confined to one of the four. In order to support
the dignity of the chief or chieftain a certain portion of the tribe
or sept land was attached as an apanage to the office; this land,
with the <i>duns</i> or fortified residences upon it, went to the successor,
but a chief&rsquo;s own property might be gavelled. This
custom of tanistry applied at first probably to the selection of
the successors of a <i>ríg</i>, but was gradually so extended that even
a <i>bó-aire</i> had a tanist.</p>

<p>A sept might have only one <i>flaith</i>, or lord, connected with
it, or might have several. It sometimes happened, however,
that a sept might be so broken and reduced as not to have even
one man qualified to rank as a <i>flaith</i>. The rank of a <i>flaith</i>
depended upon the number of his <i>ceiles</i>, that is, upon his wealth.
The <i>flaith</i> of a sept, and the highest when there was more than
one, was <i>ceann fine</i>, or head of the sept, or as he was usually
called in Scotland, the chieftain. He was also called the <i>flaith
geilfine</i>, or head of the <i>geilfine</i>, that is, the kinsmen to the fifth
degree from among whom should be chosen the tanist, and who,
according to the custom of gavel-kind, were the immediate heirs
who received the personal property and were answerable for the
liabilities of the sept. The <i>flaiths</i> of the different septs were the
vassals of the <i>ríg</i>, or chief of the tribe, and performed certain
functions which were no doubt at first individual, but in time
became the hereditary right of the sept. One of those was the
office of <i>maer</i>, or steward of the chief&rsquo;s rents, &amp;c.;<a name="FnAnchor_4g" id="FnAnchor_4g" href="#Footnote_4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and another
that of <i>aire tuisi</i>, leading <i>aire</i>, or <i>taoisech</i>, a word cognate with
the Latin <i>duc-s</i> or <i>dux</i>, and Anglo-Saxon here-<i>tog</i>, leader of the
&ldquo;here,&rdquo; or army. The <i>taoisech</i> was leader of the tribe in battle;
in later times the term seems to have been extended to several
offices of rank. The cadet of a Highland clan was always called
the <i>taoisech</i>, which has been translated captain; after the
conquest of Wales the same term, <i>tywysaug</i>, was used for a ruling
prince. Slavery was very common in Ireland and Scotland;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
in the former slaves constituted a common element in the
stipends or gifts which the higher kings gave their vassal <i>sub-reguli</i>.
Female slaves, who were employed in the houses of
chiefs and <i>flaiths</i> in grinding meal with the hand-mill or quern,
and in other domestic work, must have been very common, for
the unit or standard for estimating the wealth of a <i>bó-aire</i>, blood-fines,
&amp;c., was called a <i>cumhal</i>, the value of which was three
cows, but which literally meant a female slave. The descendants
of those slaves, prisoners of war, forfeited hostages, refugees
from other tribes, broken tribesmen, &amp;c., gathered round the
residence of the <i>ríg</i> and <i>flaiths</i>, or squatted upon their march-lands,
forming a motley band of retainers which made a considerable
element in the population, and one of the chief sources of
the wealth of chiefs and <i>flaiths</i>. The other principal source of
their income was the food-rent paid by <i>ceiles</i>, and especially
by the <i>daer</i> or bond <i>ceiles</i>, who were hence called <i>biathachs</i>,
from <i>biad</i>, food. A <i>flaith</i>, but not a <i>ríg</i>, might, if he liked, go to
the house of his <i>ceile</i> and consume his food-rent in the house of
the latter.</p>

<p>Under the influence of feudal ideas and the growth of the
modern views as to ownership of land, the chiefs and other
lords of clans claimed in modern times the right of best owing
the tribe-land as <i>turcrec</i>, instead of stock, and receiving rent not
for cattle and other chattels as in former times, but proportionate
to the extent of land given to them. The <i>turcrec</i>-land seems to
have been at first given upon the same terms as <i>turcrec</i>-stock,
but gradually a system of short leases grew up; sometimes,
too, it was given on mortgage. In the Highlands of Scotland
<i>ceiles</i> who received <i>turcrec</i>-land were called &ldquo;taksmen.&rdquo; On the
death of the chief or lord, his successor either bestowed the
land upon the same person or gave it to some other relative.
In this way in each generation new families came into possession
of land, and others sank into the mass of mere tribesmen. Sometimes
a &ldquo;taksman&rdquo; succeeded in acquiring his land in perpetuity,
by gift, marriage or purchase, or even by the &ldquo;strong hand.&rdquo;
The universal prevalence of exchangeable allotments, or the
rundale system, shows that down to even comparatively modern
times some of the land was still recognized as the property of
the tribe, and was cultivated in village communities.</p>

<p>The chief governed the clan by the aid of a council called
the <i>sabaid</i> (<i>sab</i>, a prop), but the chief exercised much power,
especially over the miscellaneous body of non-tribesmen who
lived on his own estate. This power seems to have extended
to life and death. Several of the <i>flaiths</i>, perhaps, all heads of
septs, also possessed somewhat extensive powers of the same
kind.</p>

<p>The Celtic dress, at least in the middle ages, consisted of a
kind of shirt reaching to a little below the knees called a <i>lenn</i>,
a jacket called an <i>inar</i>, and a garment called a <i>brat</i>, consisting
of a single piece of cloth. This was apparently the garb of the
<i>aires</i>, who appear to have been further distinguished by the
number of colours in their dress, for we are told that while a
slave had clothes of one colour, a <i>rég tuatha</i>, or chief of a tribe,
had five, and an <i>ollamh</i> and a superior king six. The breeches
was also known, and cloaks with a cowl or hood, which buttoned
up tight in front. The <i>lenn</i> is the modern kilt, and the <i>brat</i> the
plaid, so that the dress of the Irish and Welsh in former times
was the same as that of the Scottish Highlander.</p>

<p>By the abolition of the heritable jurisdiction of the Highland
chiefs, and the general disarmament of the clans by the acts
passed in 1747 after the rebellion of 1745, the clan system was
practically broken up, though its influence still lingers in the
more remote districts. An act was also passed in 1747 forbidding
the use of the Highland garb; but the injustice and
impolicy of such a law being generally felt it was afterwards
repealed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1g" id="Footnote_1g" href="#FnAnchor_1g"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The following account of the Irish clan-system differs in some
respects from that in the article on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brehon Laws</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>); but it is
retained here in view of the authority of the writer and the admitted
obscurity of the whole subject.</p>
<div class="author">(ED. <i>E. B.</i>)</div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2g" id="Footnote_2g" href="#FnAnchor_2g"><span class="fn">2</span></a> The explanation here given of <i>geilfine</i> is different from that given
in the introduction to the third volume of the <i>Ancient Laws of
Ireland</i>, which was followed by Sir H.S. Maine in his account of it
in his <i>Early History of Institutions</i>, and which the present writer
believes to be erroneous.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3g" id="Footnote_3g" href="#FnAnchor_3g"><span class="fn">3</span></a> It should also be mentioned that illegitimacy was not a bar.
The issue of &ldquo;handfast&rdquo; marriages in Scotland were eligible to be
chiefs, and even sometimes claimed under feudal law.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4g" id="Footnote_4g" href="#FnAnchor_4g"><span class="fn">4</span></a> This office is of considerable importance in connexion with early
Scottish history. In the Irish annals the <i>ríg</i>, or chief of a great tribe
(<i>mor tuath</i>), such as of Ross, Moray, Marr, Buchan, &amp;c., is called a
<i>mor maer</i>, or great <i>maer</i>. Sometimes the same person is called king
also in these annals. Thus <i>Findlaec</i>, or Finlay, son of <i>Ruadhri</i>, the
father of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macbeth, is called king of Moray in the
<i>Annals of Ulster</i>, and <i>mor maer</i> in the <i>Annals of Tighernach</i>. The
term is never found in Scottish charters, but it occurs in the Book
of the Abbey of Deir in Buchan, now in the library of the university
of Cambridge. The Scotic kings and their successors obviously
regarded the chiefs of the great tribes in question merely as their
<i>maers</i>, while their tribesmen only knew them as kings. From these
&ldquo;mor-maerships,&rdquo; which corresponded with the ancient <i>mor tuatha</i>,
came most, if not all, the ancient Scottish earldoms.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLANRICARDE, ULICK DE BURGH<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Bourke</span> or <span class="sc">Burke</span>),
1st <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (d. 1544), styled MacWilliam, and Ne-gan or Na-gCeann
(<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;of the Heads,&rdquo; &ldquo;having made a mount of the
heads of men slain in battle which he covered up with earth&rdquo;),
was the son of Richard or Rickard de Burgh, lord of Clanricarde,
by a daughter of Madden of Portumna, and grandson of Ulick de
Burgh, lord of Clanricarde (1467-1487), the collateral heir male of
the earls of Ulster. On the death of the last earl in 1333, his only
child Elizabeth had married Lionel, duke of Clarence, and the
earldom became merged in the crown, in consequence of which
the de Burghs abjured English laws and sovereignty, and chose
for their chiefs the sons of Sir William, the &ldquo;Red&rdquo; earl of
Ulster&rsquo;s brother, the elder William taking the title of MacWilliam
Eighter (Uachtar, <i>i.e.</i> Upper), and becoming the ancestor of the
earls of Clanricarde, and his brother Sir Edmond that of MacWilliam
Oughter (Ochtar, <i>i.e.</i> Lower), and founding the family
of the earls of Mayo. In 1361 the duke of Clarence was sent over
as lord-lieutenant to Ireland to enforce his claims as husband of
the heir general, but failed, and the chiefs of the de Burghs
maintained their independence of English sovereignty for several
generations. Ulick de Burgh succeeded to the headship of his
clan, exercised a quasi-royal authority and held vast estates in
county Galway, in Connaught, including Loughry, Dunkellin, Kiltartan
(Hilltaraght) and Athenry, as well as Clare and Leitrim.
In March 1541, however, he wrote to Henry VIII., lamenting the
degeneracy of his family, &ldquo;which have been brought to Irish and
disobedient rule by reason of marriage and nurseing with those
Irish, sometime rebels, near adjoining to me,&rdquo; and placing
himself and his estates in the king&rsquo;s hands. The same year he was
present at Dublin, when the act was passed making Henry VIII.
king of Ireland. In 1543, in company with other Irish chiefs, he
visited the king at Greenwich, made full submission, undertook to
introduce English manners and abandon Irish names, received a
regrant of the greater part of his estates with the addition of
other lands, was confirmed in the captainship and rule of Clanricarde,
and was created on the 1st of July 1543 earl of Clanricarde
and baron of Dunkellin in the peerage of Ireland, with unusual
ceremony. &ldquo;The making of McWilliam earl of Clanricarde
made all the country during his time quiet and obedient,&rdquo; states
Lord Chancellor Cusake in his review of the state of Ireland in
1553.<a name="FnAnchor_1g1" id="FnAnchor_1g1" href="#Footnote_1g1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He did not live long, however, to enjoy his new English
dignities, but died shortly after returning to Ireland about March
1544. He is called by the annalist of Loch Cé &ldquo;a haughty and
proud lord,&rdquo; who reduced many under his yoke, and by the Four
Masters &ldquo;the most illustrious of the English in Connaught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clanricarde married (1) Grany or Grace, daughter of Mulrone
O&rsquo;Carroll, &ldquo;prince of Ely,&rdquo; by whom he had Richard or Rickard
&ldquo;the Saxon,&rdquo; who succeeded him as 2nd earl of Clanricarde
(grandfather of the 4th earl, whose son became marquess of
Clanricarde), this alliance being the only one declared valid.
After parting with his first wife he married (2) Honora, sister
of Ulick de Burgh, from whom he also parted. He married
(3) Mary Lynch, by whom he had John, who claimed the
earldom in 1568. Other sons, according to Burke&rsquo;s <i>Peerage</i>,
were Thomas &ldquo;the Athlete,&rdquo; shot in 1545, Redmond &ldquo;of the
Broom&rdquo; (d. 1595), and Edmund (d. 1597).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLANRICARDE, ULICK DE BURGH<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Bourke</span> or <span class="sc">Burke</span>),
<span class="sc">Marquess of</span> (1604-1657 or 1658), son of Richard, 4th earl of
Clanricarde, created in 1628 earl of St Albans, and of Frances,
daughter and heir of Sir Francis Walsingham, and widow of Sir
Philip Sidney and of Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, was born in
1604. He was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Burgh in
1628, and succeeded his father as 5th earl in 1635. He sat in the
Short Parliament of 1640 and attended Charles I. in the Scottish
expedition. On the outbreak of the Irish rebellion Clanricarde
had powerful inducements for joining the Irish&mdash;the ancient
greatness and independence of his family, his devotion to the
Roman Catholic Church, and strongest of all, the ungrateful
treatment meted out by Charles I. and Wentworth to his father,
one of Elizabeth&rsquo;s most stanch adherents in Ireland, whose lands
were appropriated by the crown and whose death, it was popularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
asserted, was hastened by the harshness of the lord-lieutenant.
Nevertheless at the crisis his loyalty never wavered. Alone of the
Irish Roman Catholic nobility to declare for the king, he returned
to Ireland, took up his residence at Portumna, kept Galway, of
which he was governor, neutral, and took measures for the
defence of the county and for the relief of the Protestants,
making &ldquo;his house and towns a refuge, nay, even a hospital for
the distressed English.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1h" id="FnAnchor_1h" href="#Footnote_1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In 1643 he was one of the commissioners
appointed by the king to confer with the Irish confederates,
and urged the wisdom of a cessation of hostilities in a
document which he publicly distributed. He was appointed
commander of the English forces in Connaught in 1644, and in
1646 was created a marquess and a privy councillor. He supported
the same year the treaty between Charles I. and the
confederates, and endeavoured after its failure to persuade
Preston, the general of the Irish, to agree to a peace; but the
latter, being advised by Rinuccini, the papal nuncio, refused in
December. Together with Ormonde, Clanricarde opposed the
nuncio&rsquo;s policy; and the royalist inhabitants of Galway
having through the latter&rsquo;s influence rejected the cessation of
hostilities, arranged with Lord Inchiquin in 1648, he besieged the
town and compelled its acquiescence. In 1649 he reduced Sligo.
On Ormonde&rsquo;s departure in December 1650 Clanricarde was
appointed deputy lord-lieutenant, but he was not trusted by the
Roman Catholics, and was unable to stem the tide of the parliamentary
successes. In 1651 he opposed the offer of Charles, duke
of Lorraine, to supply money and aid on condition of being
acknowledged &ldquo;Protector&rdquo; of the kingdom. In May 1652
Galway surrendered to the parliament, and in June Clanricarde
signed articles with the parliamentary commissioners which
allowed his departure from Ireland. In August he was excepted
from pardon for life and estate, but by permits, renewed from
time to time by the council, he was enabled to remain in England
for the rest of his life, and in 1653 £500 a year was settled upon
him by the council of state in consideration of the protection
which he had given to the Protestants in Ireland at the time of
the rebellion. He died at Somerhill in Kent in 1657 or 1658 and
was buried at Tunbridge.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;great earl,&rdquo; as he was called, supported Ormonde in his
desire to unite the English royalists with the more moderate
Roman Catholics on the basis of religious toleration under the
authority of the sovereign, against the papal scheme advocated by
Rinuccini, and in opposition to the parliamentary and Puritan
policy. By the author of the <i>Aphorismical Discovery</i>, who
represents the opinion of the native Irish, he is denounced as the
&ldquo;masterpiece of the treasonable faction,&rdquo; &ldquo;a foe to his king,
nation and religion,&rdquo; and by the duke of Lorraine as &ldquo;a traitor
and a base fellow&rdquo;; but there is no reason to doubt Clarendon&rsquo;s
opinion of him as &ldquo;a person of unquestionable fidelity. . . and
of the most eminent constancy to the Roman Catholic religion of
any man in the three kingdoms,&rdquo; or the verdict of Hallam, who
describes him &ldquo;as perhaps the most unsullied character in the
annals of Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He married Lady Anne Compton, daughter of William
Compton, 1st earl of Northampton, but had issue only one
daughter. On his death, accordingly, the marquessate and the
English peerages became extinct, the Irish titles reverting to his
cousin Richard, 6th earl, grandson of the 3rd earl of Clanricarde.
Henry, the 12th earl (1742-1797), was again created a marquess in
1789, but the marquessate expired at his death without issue, the
earldom going to his brother. In 1825 the 14th earl (1802-1874)
was created a marquess; he was ambassador at St Petersburg,
and later postmaster-general and lord privy seal, and married
George Canning&rsquo;s daughter. His son (b. 1832), who achieved
notoriety in the Irish land agitation, succeeded him as 2nd
marquess.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLANVOWE, SIR THOMAS<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span>, the name of an English poet first
mentioned in the history of English literature by F.S. Ellis in
1896, when, in editing the text of <i>The Book of Cupid, God of Love,
or The Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i>, for the Kelmscott Press, he
stated that Professor Skeat had discovered that at the end of the
best of the MSS. the author was called Clanvowe. In 1897 this
information was confirmed and expanded by Professor Skeat in
the supplementary volume of his Clarendon Press <i>Chaucer</i> (1894-1897).
The beautiful romance of <i>The Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i>
was published by Thynne in 1532, and was attributed by him, and
by successive editors down to the days of Henry Bradshaw, to
Chaucer. It was due to this error that for three centuries
Chaucer was supposed to be identified with the manor of Woodstock,
and even painted, in fanciful pictures, as lying</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr f90">

<p>&ldquo;Under a maple that is fair and green,</p>
<p class="i05">Before the chamber-window of the Queen</p>
<p class="i05">At Wodëstock, upon the greenë lea.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But this queen could only be Joan of Navarre, who arrived
in 1403, three years after Chaucer&rsquo;s death, and it is to the
spring of that year that Professor Skeat attributes the composition
of the poem. Sir Thomas Clanvowe was of a Herefordshire
family, settled near Wigmore. He was a prominent figure in the
courts of Richard II. and Henry IV., and is said to have been a
friend of Prince Hal. He was one of those who &ldquo;had begun to
mell of Lollardy, and drink the gall of heresy.&rdquo; He was one of the
twenty-five knights who accompanied John Beaufort (son of
John of Gaunt) to Barbary in 1390.</p>

<p>The date of his birth is unknown, and his name is last mentioned
in 1404. The historic and literary importance of <i>The Cuckoo and
the Nightingale</i> is great. It is the work of a poet who had studied
the prosody of Chaucer with more intelligent care than either
Occleve or Lydgate, and who therefore forms an important link
between the 14th and 15th centuries in English poetry. Clanvowe
writes with a surprising delicacy and sweetness, in a five-line
measure almost peculiar to himself. Professor Skeat points out a
unique characteristic of Clanvowe&rsquo;s versification, namely, the
unprecedented freedom with which he employs the suffix of the
final <i>-e</i>, and rather avoids than seeks elision. <i>The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale</i> was imitated by Milton in his sonnet to the Nightingale,
and was rewritten in modern English by Wordsworth. It is
a poem of so much individual beauty, that we must regret the
apparent loss of everything else written by a poet of such unusual
talent.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAPARÈDE, JEAN LOUIS RENÉ ANTOINE ÉDOUARD<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span>
(1832-1870), Swiss naturalist, was born at Geneva on the 24th of
April 1832. He belonged to a French family, some members of
which had taken refuge in that city after the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes. In 1852 he began to study medicine and natural
science at Berlin, where he was greatly influenced by J. Müller
and C.G. Ehrenberg, the former being at that period engaged in
his important researches on the Echinoderms. In 1855 he
accompanied Müller to Norway, and there spent two months on a
desolate reef that he might obtain satisfactory observations.
The latter part of his stay at Berlin he devoted, along with J.
Lachmann, to the study of the Infusoria and Rhizopods. In 1857
he obtained the degree of doctor, and in 1862 he was chosen
professor of comparative anatomy at Geneva. In 1859 he
visited England, and in company with W.B. Carpenter made a
voyage to the Hebrides; and in 1863 he spent some months in the
Bay of Biscay. On the appearance of Darwin&rsquo;s work on the
<i>Origin of Species</i>, he adopted his theories and published a
valuable series of articles on the subject in the <i>Revue Germanique</i>
(1861). During 1865 and 1866 ill-health rendered him incapable
of work, and he determined to pass the winter of 1866-1867 in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
Naples. The change of climate produced some amelioration, and
his energy was attested by two elaborate volumes on the
Annelidae of the gulf. He again visited Naples with advantage
in 1868; but in 1870, instead of recovering as before, he grew
worse, and on the 31st of May he died at Siena on his way home.
His <i>Recherches sur la structure des annélides sédentaires</i> were
published posthumously in 1873.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAPPERTON, HUGH<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1788-1827), Scottish traveller in West-Central
Africa, was born in 1788 at Annan, Dumfriesshire, where
his father was a surgeon. He gained some knowledge of practical
mathematics and navigation, and at thirteen was apprenticed on
board a vessel which traded between Liverpool and North
America. After having made several voyages across the Atlantic
he was impressed for the navy, in which he soon rose to the rank
of midshipman. During the Napoleonic wars he saw a good deal
of active service, and at the storming of Port Louis, Mauritius, in
November 1810, he was first in the breach and hauled down the
French flag. In 1814 he went to Canada, was promoted to the
rank of lieutenant, and to the command of a schooner on the
Canadian lakes. In 1817, when the flotilla on the lakes was
dismantled, he returned home on half-pay.</p>

<p>In 1820 Clapperton removed to Edinburgh, where he made
the acquaintance of Walter Oudney, M.D., who aroused in him an
interest in African travel. Lieut. G.F. Lyon, R.N., having
returned from an unsuccessful attempt to reach Bornu from
Tripoli, the British government determined on a second expedition
to that country. Dr Oudney was appointed by Lord
Bathurst, then colonial secretary, to proceed to Bornu as consul
with the object of promoting trade, and Clapperton and Major
Dixon Denham (<i>q.v.</i>) were added to the party. From Tripoli,
early in 1822, they set out southward to Murzuk, and from this
point Clapperton and Oudney visited the Ghat oasis. Kuka, the
capital of Bornu, was reached in February 1823, and Lake Chad
seen for the first time by Europeans. At Bornu the travellers
were well received by the sultan; and after remaining in the
country till the 14th of December they again set out for the
purpose of exploring the course of the Niger. At Murmur, on the
road to Kano, Oudney died (January 1824). Clapperton continued
his journey alone through Kano to Sokoto, the capital of
the Fula empire, where by order of Sultan Bello he was obliged to
stop, though the Niger was only five days&rsquo; journey to the west.
Worn out with his travel he returned by way of Zaria and
Katsena to Kuka, where he again met Denham. The two
travellers then set out for Tripoli, reached on the 26th of January
1825. An account of the travels was published in 1826 under the
title of <i>Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and
Central Africa in the years 1822-1824</i>.</p>

<p>Immediately after his return Clapperton was raised to the rank
of commander, and sent out with another expedition to Africa,
the sultan Bello of Sokoto having professed his eagerness to open
up trade with the west coast. Clapperton landed at Badagry in
the Bight of Benin, and started overland for the Niger on the 7th
of December 1825, having with him his servant Richard Lander
(<i>q.v.</i>), Captain Pearce, R.N., and Dr Morrison, navy surgeon and
naturalist. Before the month was out Pearce and Morrison were
dead of fever. Clapperton continued his journey, and, passing
through the Yoruba country, in January 1826 he crossed the
Niger at Bussa, the spot where Mungo Park had died twenty years
before. In July he arrived at Kano. Thence he went to Sokoto,
intending afterwards to go to Bornu. The sultan, however,
detained him, and being seized with dysentery he died near
Sokoto on the 13th of April 1827.</p>

<p>Clapperton was the first European to make known from
personal observation the semi-civilized Hausa countries, which he
visited soon after the establishment of the Sokoto empire by the
Fula. In 1829 appeared the <i>Journal of a Second Expedition into
the Interior of Africa</i>, &amp;c, by the late Commander Clapperton,
to which was prefaced a biographical sketch of the explorer by his
uncle, Lieut.-colonel S. Clapperton. Lander, who had brought
back the journal of his master, also published <i>Records of Captain
Clapperton&rsquo;s Last Expedition to Africa . . . with the subsequent
Adventures of the Author</i> (2 vols., London, 1830).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAQUE<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (Fr. <i>claquer</i>, to clap the hands), an organized body
of professional applauders in the French theatres. The hiring
of persons to applaud dramatic performances was common in
classical times, and the emperor Nero, when he acted, had his
performance greeted by an encomium chanted by five thousand
of his soldiers, who were called Angustals. The recollection of
this gave the 16th-century French poet, Jean Daurat, an idea
which has developed into the modern claque. Buying up a
number of tickets for a performance of one of his plays, he distributed
them gratuitously to those who promised publicly to
express their approbation. It was not, however, till 1820 that
a M. Sauton seriously undertook the systematization of the
claque, and opened an office in Paris for the supply of <i>claqueurs</i>.
By 1830 the claque had become a regular institution. The
manager of a theatre sends an order for any number of <i>claqueurs</i>.
These people are usually under a <i>chef de claque</i>, whose duty it is
to judge where their efforts are needed and to start the demonstration
of approval. This takes several forms. Thus there are
<i>commissaires</i>, those who learn the piece by heart, and call the
attention of their neighbours to its good points between the
acts. The <i>rieurs</i> are those who laugh loudly at the jokes. The
<i>pleureurs</i>, generally women, feign tears, by holding their handkerchiefs
to their eyes. The <i>chatouilleurs</i> keep the audience in a
good humour, while the <i>bisseurs</i> simply clap their hands and cry
<i>bis! bis!</i> to secure encores.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARA, SAINT<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1194-1253), foundress of the Franciscan
nuns, was born of a knightly family in Assisi in 1194. At
eighteen she was so impressed by a sermon of St Francis that
she was filled with the desire to devote herself to the kind of life
he was leading. She obtained an interview with him, and to
test her resolution he told her to dress in penitential sackcloth
and beg alms for the poor in the streets of Assisi. Clara readily
did this, and Francis, satisfied as to her vocation, told her to
come to the Portiuncula arrayed as a bride. The friars met her
with lighted candles, and at the foot of the altar Francis shore
off her hair, received her vows of poverty, chastity and obedience,
and invested her with the Franciscan habit, 1212. He placed
her for a couple of years in a Benedictine convent in Assisi,
until the convent at St Damian&rsquo;s, close to the town, was ready.
Her two younger sisters, and, after her father&rsquo;s death, her
mother and many others joined her, and the Franciscan nuns
spread widely and rapidly (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Clares, Poor</a></span>). The relations
of friendship and sympathy between St Clara and St Francis
were very close, and there can be no doubt that she was one of
the truest heirs of Francis&rsquo;s inmost spirit. After his death
Clara threw herself wholly on the side of those who opposed
mitigations in the rule and manner of life, and she was one of
the chief upholders of St Francis&rsquo;s primitive idea of poverty
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franciscans</a></span>). She was the close friend of Brother Leo
and the other &ldquo;Companions of St Francis,&rdquo; and they assisted
at her death. For forty years she was abbess at St Damian&rsquo;s,
and the great endeavour of her life was that the rule of the nuns
should be purged of the foreign elements that had been introduced,
and should become wholly conformable to St Francis&rsquo;s
spirit. She lived just long enough to witness the fulfilment of
her great wish, a rule such as she desired being approved by the
pope two days before her death on the 11th of August 1253.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARE<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span>, the name of a famous English family. The ancestor
of this historic house, &ldquo;which played,&rdquo; in Freeman&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;so great a part alike in England, Wales and Ireland,&rdquo; was
Count Godfrey, eldest of the illegitimate sons of Richard the
Fearless, duke of Normandy. His son, Count Gilbert of Brionne,
had two sons, Richard, lord of Bienfaite and Orbec, and Baldwin,
lord of Le Sap and Meulles, both of whom accompanied the
Conqueror to England. Baldwin, known as &ldquo;De Meulles&rdquo; or
&ldquo;of Exeter,&rdquo; received the hereditary shrievalty of Devon with
great estates in the West Country, and left three sons, William,
Robert and Richard, of whom the first and last were in turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>
sheriffs of Devon. Richard, known as &ldquo;de Bienfaite,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;of Tunbridge,&rdquo; or &ldquo;of Clare,&rdquo; was the founder of the house
of Clare.</p>

<p>Richard derived his English appellation from his strongholds
at Tunbridge and at Clare, at both of which his castle-mounds
still remain. The latter, on the borders of Essex and Suffolk,
was the head of his great &ldquo;honour&rdquo; which lay chiefly in the
eastern counties. Appointed joint justiciar in the king&rsquo;s absence
abroad, he took a leading part in suppressing the revolt of 1075.
By his wife, Rohese, daughter of Walter Giffard, through whom
great Giffard estates afterwards came to his house, he left five
sons and two daughters. Roger was his heir in Normandy,
Walter founded Tintern Abbey, Richard was a monk, and
Robert, receiving the forfeited fief of the Baynards in the eastern
counties, founded, through his son Walter, the house of FitzWalter
(extinct 1432), of whom the most famous was Robert
FitzWalter, the leader of the barons against King John. Of
this house, spoken of by Jordan Fantosme as &ldquo;Clarreaus,&rdquo;
the Daventrys of Daventry (extinct 1380) and Fawsleys of
Fawsley (extinct 1392) were cadets. One of Richard&rsquo;s two
daughters married the famous Walter Tirel.</p>

<p>Gilbert, Richard&rsquo;s heir in England, held his castle of Tunbridge
against William Rufus, but was wounded and captured. Under
Henry I., who favoured the Clares, he obtained a grant of
Cardigan, and carried his arms into Wales. Dying about 1115,
he left four sons, of whom Gilbert, the second, inherited Chepstow,
with Nether-Gwent, from his uncle, Walter, the founder
of Tintern, and was created earl of Pembroke by Stephen about
1138; he was father of Richard Strongbow, earl of Pembroke
(<i>q.v.</i>). The youngest son Baldwin fought for Stephen at the
battle of Lincoln (1141) and founded the priories of Bourne
and Deeping on lands acquired with his wife. The eldest son
Richard, who was slain by the Welsh on his way to Cardigan
in 1135 or 1136, left two sons Gilbert and Roger, of whom
Gilbert was created earl of Hertfordshire by Stephen.</p>

<p>It was probably because he and the Clares had no interests in
Hertfordshire that they were loosely and usually styled the
earls of (de) Clare. Dying in 1152, Gilbert was succeeded by
his brother Roger, of whom Fitz-Stephen observes that &ldquo;nearly
all the nobles of England were related to the earl of Clare, whose
sister, the most beautiful woman in England, had long been
desired by the king&rdquo; (Henry II.). He was constantly fighting
the Welsh for his family possessions in Wales and quarrelled
with Becket over Tunbridge Castle. In 1173 or 1174 he was
succeeded by his son Richard as third earl, whose marriage
with Amicia, daughter and co-heir of William, earl of Gloucester,
was destined to raise the fortunes of his house to their highest
point. He and his son Gilbert were among the &ldquo;barons of the
Charter,&rdquo; Gilbert, who became fourth earl in 1217, obtained
also, early in 1218, the earldom of Gloucester, with its great
territorial &ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; and the lordship of Glamorgan, in right
of his mother; &ldquo;from this time the house of Clare became the
acknowledged head of the baronage.&rdquo; Gilbert had also inherited
through his father his grandmother&rsquo;s &ldquo;Honour of St Hilary&rdquo;
and a moiety of the Giffard fief; but the vast possessions of
his house were still further swollen by his marriage with a
daughter of William (Marshal), earl of Pembroke, through
whom his son Richard succeeded in 1245 to a fifth of the Marshall
lands including the Kilkenny estates in Ireland. Richard&rsquo;s
successor, Gilbert, the &ldquo;Red&rdquo; earl, died in 1295, the most
powerful subject in the kingdom.</p>

<p>On his death his earldoms seem to have been somewhat
mysteriously deemed to have passed to his widow Joan, daughter
of Edward I.; for her second husband, Ralph de Monthermer,
was summoned to parliament in right of them from 1299 to 1306.
After her death, however, in 1307, Earl Gilbert&rsquo;s son and namesake
was summoned in 1308 as earl of Gloucester and Hertford,
though only sixteen. A nephew of Edward II. and brother-in-law
of Gaveston, he played a somewhat wavering part in the
struggle between the king and the barons. Guardian of the
realm in 1311 and regent in 1313, he fell gloriously at Bannockburn
(June 24th, 1314), when only twenty-three, rushing on
the enemy &ldquo;like a wild boar, making his sword drunk with
their blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earl was the last of his mighty line, and his vast possessions
in England (in over twenty counties), Wales and Ireland
fell to his three sisters, of whom Elizabeth, the youngest, wife
of John de Burgh, obtained the &ldquo;Honour of Clare&rdquo; and transmitted
it to her son William de Burgh, 3rd earl of Ulster, whose
daughter brought it to Lionel, son of King Edward III., who
was thereupon created duke of Clarence, a title associated ever
since with the royal house. The &ldquo;Honour of Clare,&rdquo; vested in
the crown, still preserves a separate existence, with a court and
steward of its own.</p>

<p>Clare College, Cambridge, derived its name from the above
Elizabeth, &ldquo;Lady of Clare,&rdquo; who founded it as Clare Hall in
1347.</p>

<p>Clare County in Ireland derives its name from the family,
though whether from Richard Strongbow, or from Thomas de
Clare, a younger son, who had a grant of Thomond in 1276, has
been deemed doubtful.</p>

<p>Clarenceux King of Arms, an officer of the Heralds&rsquo; College,
derives his style, through Clarence, from Clare.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARE, JOHN<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1793-1864), English poet, commonly known
as &ldquo;the Northamptonshire Peasant Poet,&rdquo; the son of a farm
labourer, was born at Helpstone near Peterborough, on the
13th of July 1793. At the age of seven he was taken from
school to tend sheep and geese; four years later he began to
work on a farm, attending in the winter evenings a school where
he is said to have learnt some algebra. He then became a pot-boy
in a public-house and fell in love with Mary Joyce, but her
father, a prosperous farmer, forbade her to meet him. Subsequently
he was gardener at Burghley Park. He enlisted in the
militia, tried camp life with gipsies, and worked as a lime burner
in 1817, but in the following year he was obliged to accept
parish relief. Clare had bought a copy of Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Seasons</i>
out of his scanty earnings and had begun to write poems. In
1819 a bookseller at Stamford, named Drury, lighted on one of
Clare&rsquo;s poems, <i>The Setting Sun</i>, written on a scrap of paper
enclosing a note to his predecessor in the business. He befriended
the author and introduced his poems to the notice
of John Taylor, of the publishing firm of Taylor &amp; Hussey,
who issued the <i>Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery</i>
in 1820. This book was highly praised, and in the next year
his <i>Village Minstrel and other Poems</i> were published. He was
greatly patronized; fame, in the shape of curious visitors, broke
the tenor of his life, and the convivial habits that he had formed
were indulged more freely. He had married in 1820, and an
annuity of 15 guineas from Lord Exeter, in whose service he had
been, was supplemented by subscription, and he became possessed
of £45 annually, a sum far beyond what he had ever
earned, but new wants made his income insufficient, and in
1823 he was nearly penniless. The <i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Calendar</i> (1827)
met with little success, which was not increased by his hawking
it himself. As he worked again on the fields his health temporarily
improved; but he soon became seriously ill. Lord
Fitzwilliam presented him with a new cottage and a piece of
ground, but Clare could not settle in his new home. Gradually
his mind gave way. His last and best work, the <i>Rural Muse</i>
(1835), was noticed by &ldquo;Christopher North&rdquo; alone. He had
for some time shown symptoms of insanity; and in July 1837 he
was removed to a private asylum, and afterwards to the Northampton
general lunatic asylum, where he died on the 20th of
May 1864. Clare&rsquo;s descriptions of rural scenes show a keen and
loving appreciation of nature, and his love-songs and ballads
charm by their genuine feeling; but his vogue was no doubt
largely due to the interest aroused by his humble position in life.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARE, JOHN FITZGIBBON<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span>, <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1749-1802), lord
chancellor of Ireland, was the second son of John Fitzgibbon,
who had abandoned the Roman Catholic faith in order to
pursue a legal career. He was educated at Trinity College,
Dublin, where he was highly distinguished as a classical scholar,
and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1770. In
1772 he was called to the Irish bar, and quickly acquired a very
lucrative practice; he also inherited his father&rsquo;s large fortune
on the death of his elder brother. In 1778 he entered the Irish
House of Commons as member for Dublin University, and at
first gave a general support to the popular party led by Henry
Grattan (<i>q.v.</i>). He was, however, from the first hostile to that
part of Grattan&rsquo;s policy which aimed at removing the disabilities
of the Roman Catholics; he endeavoured to impede the Relief
Bill of 1778 by raising difficulties about its effect on the Act of
Settlement. He especially distrusted the priests, and many
years later explained that his life-long resistance to all concession
to the Catholics was based on his &ldquo;unalterable opinion&rdquo; that
&ldquo;a conscientious Popish ecclesiastic never will become a well-attached
subject to a Protestant state, and that the Popish
clergy must always have a commanding influence on every
member of that communion.&rdquo; As early as 1780 Fitzgibbon
began to separate himself from the popular or national party,
by opposing Grattan&rsquo;s declaration of the Irish parliament&rsquo;s
right to independence. There is no reason to suppose that in
this change of view he was influenced by corrupt or personal
motives. His cast of mind naturally inclined to authority
rather than to democratic liberty; his hostility to the Catholic
claims, and his distrust of parliamentary reform as likely to
endanger the connexion of Ireland with Great Britain, made him
a sincere opponent of the aims which Grattan had in view.
In reply, however, to a remonstrance from his constituents
Fitzgibbon promised to support Grattan&rsquo;s policy in the future,
and described the claim of Great Britain to make laws for Ireland
as &ldquo;a daring usurpation of the rights of a free people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some time longer there was no actual breach between him
and Grattan. Grattan supported the appointment of Fitzgibbon
as attorney-general in 1783, and in 1785 the latter highly eulogized
Grattan&rsquo;s character and services to the country in a speech
in which he condemned Flood&rsquo;s volunteer movement. He also
opposed Flood&rsquo;s Reform Bill of 1784; and from this time
forward he was in fact the leading spirit in the Irish government,
and the stiffest opponent of all concession to popular demands.
In 1784 the permanent committee of revolutionary reformers in
Dublin, of whom Napper Tandy was the most conspicuous,
invited the sheriffs of counties to call meetings for the election of
delegates to attend a convention for the discussion of reform; and
when the sheriff of the county of Dublin summoned a meeting for
this purpose Fitzgibbon procured his imprisonment for contempt
of court, and justified this procedure in parliament, though Lord
Erskine declared it grossly illegal. In the course of the debates
on Pitt&rsquo;s commercial propositions in 1785, which Fitzgibbon
supported in masterly speeches, he referred to Curran in terms
which led to a duel between the two lawyers, when Fitzgibbon
was accused of a deliberation in aiming at his opponent that was
contrary to etiquette. His antagonism to Curran was life-long
and bitter, and after he became chancellor his hostility to the
famous advocate was said to have driven the latter out of
practice. In January 1787 Fitzgibbon introduced a stringent
bill for repressing the Whiteboy outrages. It was supported by
Grattan, who, however, procured the omission of a clause
enacting that any Roman Catholic chapel near which an illegal
oath had been tendered should be immediately demolished. His
influence with the majority in the Irish parliament defeated
Pitt&rsquo;s proposed reform of the tithe system in Ireland, Fitzgibbon
refusing even to grant a committee to investigate the subject.
On the regency question in 1789 Fitzgibbon, in opposition to
Grattan, supported the doctrine of Pitt in a series of powerful
speeches which proved him a great constitutional lawyer; he
intimated that the choice for Ireland might in certain eventualities
rest between complete separation from England and
legislative union; and, while he exclaimed as to the latter
alternative, &ldquo;God forbid that I should ever see that day!&rdquo; he
admitted that separation would be the worse evil of the two.</p>

<p>In the same year Lord Lifford resigned the chancellorship, and
Fitzgibbon was appointed in his place, being raised to the peerage
as Baron Fitzgibbon. His removal to the House of Lords
greatly increased his power. In the Commons, though he had
exercised great influence as attorney-general, his position had
been secondary; in the House of Lords and in the privy council
he was little less than despotic. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; says Lecky, &ldquo;by far
the ablest Irishman who had adopted without restriction the
doctrine that the Irish legislature must be maintained in a
condition of permanent and unvarying subjection to the English
executive.&rdquo; But the English ministry were now embarking on a
policy of conciliation in Ireland. The Catholic Relief Bill of 1793
was forced on the Irish executive by the cabinet in London, but
it passed rapidly and easily through the Irish parliament.
Lord Fitzgibbon, while accepting the bill as inevitable under the
circumstances that had arisen, made a most violent though
exceedingly able speech against the principle of concession,
which did much to destroy the conciliatory effect of the measure;
and as a consequence of this act he began persistently to urge the
necessity for a legislative union. From this date until the union
was carried, the career of Fitzgibbon is practically the history of
Ireland. True to his inveterate hostility to the popular claims,
he was opposed to the appointment of Lord Fitzwilliam (<i>q.v.</i>) as
viceroy in 1795, and was probably the chief influence in procuring
his recall; and it was Fitzgibbon who first put it into the head of
George III. that the king would violate his coronation oath if he
consented to the admission of Catholics to parliament. When
Lord Camden, Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s successor in the viceroyalty, arrived
in Dublin on the 31st of March 1795, Fitzgibbon&rsquo;s carriage was
violently assaulted by the mob, and he himself was wounded;
and in the riots that ensued his house was also attacked. But as
if to impress upon the Catholics the hopelessness of their case, the
government who had made Fitzgibbon a viscount immediately
after his attack on the Catholics in 1793 now bestowed on him a
further mark of honour. In June 1795 he was created earl of
Clare. On the eve of the rebellion he warned the government
that while emancipation and reform might be the objects aimed
at by the better classes, the mass of the disaffected had in view
&ldquo;the separation of the country from her connexion with Great
Britain, and a fraternal alliance with the French Republic.&rdquo;
Clare advocated stringent measures to prevent an outbreak; but
he was neither cruel nor immoderate, and was inclined to mercy
in dealing with individuals. He attempted to save Lord Edward
Fitzgerald (<i>q.v.</i>) from his fate by giving a friendly warning to his
friends, and promising to facilitate his escape from the country;
and Lord Edward&rsquo;s aunt, Lady Louisa Conolly, who was conducted
to his death-bed in prison by the chancellor in person,
declared that &ldquo;nothing could exceed Lord Clare&rsquo;s kindness.&rdquo;
His moderation and humanity after the rebellion was extolled by
Cornwallis. He threw his great influence on the side of clemency,
and it was through his intervention that Oliver Bond, when
sentenced to death, was reprieved; and that an arrangement was
made by which Arthur O&rsquo;Connor, Thomas Emmet and other
state prisoners were allowed to leave the country.</p>

<p>In October 1798 Lord Clare, who since 1793 had been convinced
of the necessity for a legislative union if the connexion
between Great Britain and Ireland was to be maintained, and
who was equally determined that the union must be unaccompanied
by Catholic emancipation, crossed to England and
successfully pressed his views on Pitt. In 1799 he induced the
Irish House of Lords to throw out a bill for providing a permanent
endowment of Maynooth. On the 10th of February 1800 Clare in
the House of Lords moved the resolution approving the union in
a long and powerful speech, in which he reviewed the history of
Ireland since the Revolution, attributing the evils of recent years
to the independent constitution of 1782, and speaking of Grattan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
in language of deep personal hatred. He was not aware of the
assurance which Cornwallis had been authorized to convey to the
Catholics that the union was to pave the way for emancipation,
and when he heard of it after the passing of the act he bitterly
complained that Pitt and Castlereagh had deceived him. After
the union Clare became more violent than ever in his opposition
to any policy of concession in Ireland. He died on the 28th of
January 1802; his funeral in Dublin was the occasion of a riot
organized &ldquo;by a gang of about fourteen persons under orders of
a leader.&rdquo; His wife, in compliance with his death-bed request,
destroyed all his papers. His two sons, John (1792-1851) and
Richard Hobart (1793-1864), succeeded in turn to the earldom,
which became extinct on the death of the latter, whose only
son, John Charles Henry, Viscount Fitzgibbon (1829-1854), was
killed in the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava.</p>

<p>Lord Clare was in private life an estimable and even an amiable
man; many acts of generosity are related of him; the determination
of his character swayed other wills to his purpose, and his
courage was such as no danger, no obloquy, no public hatred or
violence could disturb. Though not a great orator like Flood or
Grattan, he was a skilful and ready debater, and he was by far
the ablest Irish supporter of the union. He was, however,
arrogant, overbearing and intolerant to the last degree. He was
the first Irishman since the Revolution to hold the office of lord
chancellor of Ireland. &ldquo;Except where his furious personal antipathies
and his ungovernable arrogance were called into action,
he appears to have been,&rdquo; says Lecky, &ldquo;an able, upright and
energetic judge&rdquo;; but as a politician there can be little question
that Lord Clare&rsquo;s bitter and unceasing resistance to reasonable
measures of reform did infinite mischief in the history of Ireland,
by inflaming the passions of his countrymen, driving them into
rebellion, and perpetuating their political and religious divisions.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARE<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span>, a county in the province of Munster, Ireland, bounded
N. by Galway Bay and Co. Galway, E. by Lough Derg, the river
Shannon, and counties Tipperary and Limerick, S. by the estuary
of the Shannon, and W. by the Atlantic Ocean. The area is
852,389 acres, or nearly 1332 sq. m. Although the surface of the
county is hilly, and in some parts even mountainous, it nowhere
rises to a great elevation. Much of the western baronies of
Moyarta and Ibrickan is composed of bog land. Bogs are
frequent also in the mountainous districts elsewhere, except in
the limestone barony of Burren, the inhabitants of some parts of
which supply themselves with turf from the opposite shores of
Connemara. Generally speaking, the eastern parts of the county
are mountainous, with tracts of rich pasture-land interspersed;
the west abounds with bog; and the north is rocky and best
adapted for grazing sheep. In the southern part, along the banks
of the Fergus and Shannon, are the bands of rich low grounds
called corcasses, of various breadth, indenting the land in a great
variety of shapes. They are composed of deep rich loam, and are
distinguished as the black corcasses, adapted for tillage, and the
blue, used more advantageously as meadow land. The coast is
in general rocky, and occasionally bold and precipitous in the
extreme, as may be observed at the picturesque cliffs of Moher
within a few miles of Ennistimon and Lisdoonvarna, which rise
perpendicularly at O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Tower to an elevation of 580 ft.
The coast of Clare is indented with several bays, the chief of
which are Ballyvaghan, Liscannor and Malbay; but from
Black Head to Loop Head, that is, along the entire western
boundary of the county formed by the Atlantic, there is no safe
harbour except Liscannor Bay. Malbay takes its name from its
dangers to navigators, and the whole coast has been the scene of
many fatal disasters. The county possesses only one large river,
the Fergus; but nearly 100 m. of its boundary-line are washed by
the river Shannon, which enters the Atlantic Ocean between this
county and Kerry. The numerous bays and creeks on both sides
of this great river render its navigation safe in every wind; but
the passage to and from Limerick is often tedious, and the port of
Kilrush has from that cause gained in importance. The river
Fergus is navigable from the Shannon to the town of Clare, which
is the terminating point of its natural navigation, and the port of
all the central districts of the county.</p>

<p>There are a great number of lakes and tarns in the county, of
which the largest are Loughs Muckanagh, Graney, Atedaun and
Dromore; but they are more remarkable for beauty than for
size or utility, with the exception of the extensive and navigable
Lough Derg, formed by the river Shannon between this county
and Tipperary. The salmon fishery of the Shannon, both as a
sport and as an industry, is famous; the Fergus also holds
salmon, and there is much good trout-fishing in the lakes for
which Ennis is a centre, and in the streams of the Atlantic seaboard.
Clare is a county which, like all the western counties of
Ireland, repays visitors in search of the pleasures of seaside
resorts, sport, scenery or antiquarian interest. Yet, again like
other western counties, it was long before it was rendered
accessible. Communications, however, are now satisfactory.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;Upper Carboniferous strata cover the county west of
Ennis, the coast-sections in them being particularly fine. Shales
and sandstones alternate, now horizontal, as in the Cliffs of Moher,
now thrown into striking folds. The Carboniferous Limestone forms
a barren terraced country, often devoid of soil, through the Burren
in the north, and extends to the estuary of the Fergus and the
Shannon. On the east, the folding has brought up two bold masses
of Old Red Sandstone, with Silurian cores. Slieve Bernagh, the more
southerly of these, rises to 1746 ft. above Killaloe, and the hilly
country here traversed by the Shannon is in marked contrast with
the upper course of the river through the great limestone plain.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;Although metals and minerals have been found in
many places throughout the county, they do not often show
themselves in sufficient abundance to induce the application of
capital for their extraction. The principal metals are lead, iron
and manganese. The Milltown lead mine in the barony of Tulla
is probably one of the oldest mines in Ireland, and formerly, if the
extent of the ancient excavations may be taken as a guide, there
must have been a very rich deposit. Copper pyrites occurs in
several parts of Burren, but in small quantity. Coal exists at
Labasheeda on the right bank of the Shannon, but the few and
thin seams are not productive. The nodules of clay-ironstone in
the strata that overlie the limestone were mined and smelted
down to 1750. Within half a mile of the Milltown lead mine are
immense natural vaulted passages of limestone, through which
the river Ardsullas winds a singular course. The lower limestone
of the eastern portion of the county has been found to contain
several very large deposits of argentiferous galena. Flags, easily
quarried, are procured near Kilrush, and thinner flags near
Ennistimon. Slates are quarried in several places, the best being
those of Broadford and Killaloe, which are nearly equal to the
finest procured in Wales. A species of very fine black marble is
obtained near Ennis; it takes a high polish, and is free from the
white spots with which the black Kilkenny marble is marked.</p>

<p>The mineral springs, which are found in many places, are
chiefly chalybeate. That of Lisdoonvarna, a sulphur spa, about
8 m. from Ennistimon, has been celebrated since the 18th century
for its medicinal qualities, and now attracts a large number of
visitors annually. It lies 9 m. by road N. of Ennistimon. There
are chalybeate springs of less note at Kilkishen, Burren, Broadfoot,
Lehinch, Kilkee, Kilrush, Killadysart, and near Milltown
Malbay. Springs called by the people &ldquo;holy&rdquo; or &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;
wells, generally mineral waters, are common; but the belief in
their power of performing cures in inveterate maladies is nearly
extinct.</p>

<p><i>Watering-places.</i>&mdash;The Atlantic Ocean and the estuary of the
Shannon afford many situations admirably adapted for summer
bathing-places. Among the most frequented of these localities
are Milltown Malbay; with one of the best beaches on the western
coast; and the neighbouring Spanish Point (named from the
scene of the wreck of two ships of the Armada); Lehinch, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
2 m. from Ennistimon on Liscannor Bay, and near the interesting
cliffs of Moher, has a magnificent beach. Kilkee is the most
fashionable watering-place on the western coast of Ireland; and
Kilrush on the Shannon estuary is also favoured.</p>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The soil and surface of the county are in general
better adapted for grazing than for tillage, and the acreage
devoted to the former consequently exceeds three times that of
the latter. Agriculture is in a backward state, and not a fifth of
the total area is under cultivation, while the acreage shows a
decrease even in the principal crops of oats and potatoes. Cattle,
sheep, poultry and pigs, however, all receive considerable
attention. Owing to the mountainous nature of the county nearly
one-seventh of the total area is quite barren.</p>

<p>There are no extensive manufactures, although flannels and
friezes are made for home use, and hosiery of various kinds,
chiefly coarse and strong, is made around Ennistimon and other
places. There are several fishing stations on the coast, and cod,
haddock, ling, sole, turbot, ray, mackerel and other fish abound,
but the rugged nature of the coast and the tempestuous sea
greatly hinder the operations of the fishermen. Near Pooldoody
is the great Burren oyster bed called the Red Bank, where a
large establishment is maintained, from which a constant supply
of the excellent Red Bank oysters is furnished to the Dublin
and other large markets. Crabs and lobsters are caught on the
shores of the Bay of Galway in every creek from Black Head to
Ardfry. In addition to the Shannon salmon fishery mentioned
above, eels abound in every rivulet, and form an important
article of consumption.</p>

<p>The Great Southern &amp; Western railway line from Limerick to
Sligo intersects the centre of the county from north to south.
From Ennis on this line the West Clare railway runs to Ennistimon
on the coast, where it turns south and follows the coast by
Milltown Malbay to Kilkee and Kilrush. Killaloe in the east of
the county is the terminus of a branch of the Great Southern
&amp; Western railway.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The population (126,244
in 1891; 112,334 in 1901; almost wholly Roman Catholic and
rural) shows a decrease among the most serious of the Irish
counties, and the emigration returns are proportionately heavy.
The principal towns, all of insignificant size, are Ennis (pop.
5093, the county town), Kilrush (4179), Kilkee (1661) and
Killaloe (885); but several of the smaller settlements, as resorts,
are of more than local importance. The county, which is divided
into 11 baronies, contains 79 parishes, and includes the Protestant
diocese of Kilfenora, the greater part of Killaloe, and a
very small portion of the diocese of Limerick. It is within the
Roman Catholic dioceses of Killaloe and Limerick. The assizes
are held at Ennis, and quarter sessions here and at Ennistimon,
Killaloe, Kilrush and Tulla. The county is divided into the
East and West parliamentary divisions, each returning one
member.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;This county, together with part of the neighbouring
district, was anciently called Thomond, that is, North Munster,
and formed part of the monarchy of the celebrated Brian
Boroihme, who held his court at Kincora near Killaloe, where
his palace was situated on the banks of the Shannon. The site
is still distinguished by extensive earthen ramparts. Settlements
were effected by the Danes, and in the 13th century by
the Anglo-Normans, but without permanently affecting the
possession of the district by its native proprietors. In 1543
Murrogh O&rsquo;Brien, after dispossessing his nephew and vainly
attempting a rebellion against the English rule, proceeded
to England and submitted to Henry VIII., resigning his name
and possessions. He soon received them back by an English
tenure, together with the title of earl of Thomond, on condition
of adopting the English dress, manners and customs. In 1565
this part of Thomond (sometimes called O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s country)
was added to Connaught, and made one of the six new counties
into which that province was divided by Sir Henry Sidney.
It was named Clare, the name being traceable either to Richard
de Clare (Strongbow), earl of Pembroke, or to his younger
brother, Thomas de Clare, who obtained a grant of Thomond
from Edward I. in 1276, and whose family for some time maintained
a precarious position in the district. Towards the close
of the reign of Elizabeth, Clare was detached from the government
of Connaught and given a separate administration; but
at the Restoration it was reunited to Munster.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The county abounds with remains of antiquities,
both military and ecclesiastical, especially in the north-western
part. There still exist above a hundred fortified castles, several
of which are inhabited. They are mostly of small extent, a
large portion being fortified dwellings. The chief of them is
Bunratty Castle, built in 1277, once inhabited by the earls of
Thomond, 10 m. W. of Limerick, on the Shannon. Those of
Ballykinvarga, Ballynalackan and Lemaneagh, all in the
north-west, should also be mentioned. Raths or encampments are
to be found in every part. They are generally circular, composed
either of large stones without mortar or of earth thrown
up and surrounded by one or more ditches. The list of abbeys
and other religious houses formerly flourishing here (some now
only known by name, but many of them surviving in ruins)
comprehends upwards of twenty. The most remarkable are&mdash;Quin,
considered one of the finest and most perfect specimens
of ancient monastic architecture in Ireland; Corcomroe; Ennis,
in which is a very fine window of uncommonly elegant workmanship;
and those on Inniscattery or Scattery Island, in the
Shannon, said to have been founded by St Senan (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kilrush</a></span>).
Kilfenora, 5 m. N.E. of Ennistimon, was until 1752 a separate
diocese, and its small cathedral is of interest, with several
neighbouring crosses and a holy well. The ruined churches
of Kilnaboy, Nouhaval and Teampul Cronan are the most
noteworthy of many in the north-west. Five round towers are
to be found in various stages of preservation&mdash;at Scattery
Island, Drumcliffe, Dysert O&rsquo;Dea, Kilnaboy and Inniscaltra
(Lough Derg). The cathedral of the diocese of Killaloe is at
the town of that name. Cromlechs are found, chiefly in the
rocky limestone district of Burren in the N.W., though there
are some in other baronies. That at Ballygannor is formed of a
stone 40 ft. long and 10 broad.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAREMONT<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span>, a city of Sullivan county, New Hampshire,
U.S.A., situated in the W. part of the state, bordering on the
Connecticut river. Pop. (1890) 5565; (1900) 6498 (1442
foreign-born); (1910) 7529. Area, 6 sq. m. It is served by two
branches of the Boston &amp; Maine railway. In Claremont is the
Fiske free library (1873), housed in a Carnegie building (1904).
The Stevens high school is richly endowed by the gift of Paran
Stevens, a native of Claremont. The city contains several
villages, the principal being Claremont, Claremont Junction
and West Claremont. Sugar river, flowing through the city
into the Connecticut and falling 223 ft. within the city limits,
furnishes good water-power. Among the manufactures are
woollen and cotton goods, paper, mining and quarrying
machinery, rubber goods, linens, shoes, wood trim and pearl
buttons. The first settlement here was made in 1762, and a
township was organized in 1764; in 1908 Claremont was
chartered as a city. It was named from Claremont, Lord
Clive&rsquo;s country place.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARENCE, DUKES OF<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span>. The early history of this English
title is identical with that of the family of Clare (<i>q.v.</i>), earls of
Gloucester, who are sometimes called earls of Clare, of which
word Clarence is a later form. The first duke of Clarence was
Lionel of Antwerp (see below), third son of Edward III., who
was created duke in 1362, and whose wife Elizabeth was a
direct descendant of the Clares, the &ldquo;Honour of Clare&rdquo; being
among the lands which she brought to her husband. When
Lionel died without sons in 1368 the title became extinct; but
in 1412 it was revived in favour of Thomas (see below), the
second son of Henry IV. The third creation of a duke of Clarence
took place in 1461, and was in favour of George (see below),
brother of the King Edward IV. When this duke, accused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
the king, was attainted and killed in 1478, his titles and estates
were forfeited. There appears to have been no other creation
of a duke of Clarence until 1789, when William, third son of
George III., was made a peer under this title. Having merged
in the crown when William became king of Great Britain and
Ireland in 1830, the title of duke of Clarence was again revived
in 1890 in favour of Albert Victor (1864-1892), the elder son of
King Edward VII., then prince of Wales, only to become extinct
for the fifth time on his death in 1892.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Lionel of Antwerp</span>, duke of Clarence (1338-1368), third
son of Edward III., was born at Antwerp on the 29th of November
1338. Betrothed when a child to Elizabeth (d. 1363), daughter
and heiress of William de Burgh, 3rd earl of Ulster (d. 1332),
he was married to her in 1352; but before this date he had
entered nominally into possession of her great Irish inheritance.
Having been named as his father&rsquo;s representative in England
in 1345 and again in 1346, Lionel was created earl of Ulster, and
joined an expedition into France in 1355, but his chief energies
were reserved for the affairs of Ireland. Appointed governor
of that country, he landed at Dublin in 1361, and in November
of the following year was created duke of Clarence, while his
father made an abortive attempt to secure for him the crown
of Scotland. His efforts to secure an effective authority over
his Irish lands were only moderately successful; and after
holding a parliament at Kilkenny, which passed the celebrated
statute of Kilkenny in 1367, he threw up his task in disgust
and returned to England. About this time a marriage was
arranged between Clarence and Violante, daughter of Galeazzo
Visconti, lord of Pavia (d. 1378); the enormous dowry which
Galeazzo promised with his daughter being exaggerated by the
rumour of the time. Journeying to fetch his bride, the duke
was received in great state both in France and Italy, and was
married to Violante at Milan in June 1368. Some months were
then spent in festivities, during which Lionel was taken ill at
Alba, where he died on the 7th of October 1368. His only child
Philippa, a daughter by his first wife, married in 1368 Edmund
Mortimer, 3rd earl of March (1351-1381), and through this
union Clarence became the ancestor of Edward IV. The poet
Chaucer was at one time a page in Lionel&rsquo;s household.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Thomas</span>, duke of Clarence (c. 1388-1421), who was nominally
lieutenant of Ireland from 1401 to 1413, and was in command of
the English fleet in 1405, acted in opposition to his elder brother,
afterwards King Henry V., and the Beauforts during the later
part of the reign of Henry IV.; and was for a short time at the
head of the government, leading an unsuccessful expedition
into France in 1412. When Henry V., however, became king
in 1413 no serious dissensions took place between the brothers,
and as a member of the royal council Clarence took part in the
preparations for the French war. He was with the English king
at Harfleur, but not at Agincourt, and shared in the expedition
of 1417 into Normandy, during which he led the assault on Caen,
and distinguished himself as a soldier in other similar
undertakings. When Henry V. returned to England in 1421, the duke
remained in France as his lieutenant, and was killed at Beaugé
whilst rashly attacking the French and their Scottish allies on
the 22nd of March 1421. He left no legitimate issue, and the
title again  became  extinct.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">George</span>, duke of Clarence (1449-1478), younger son of Richard,
duke of York, by his wife Cicely, daughter of Ralph Neville,
1st earl of Westmorland, was born in Dublin on the 21st of
October 1449. Soon after his elder brother became king as
Edward IV. in March 1461, he was created duke of Clarence,
and his youth was no bar to his appointment as lord-lieutenant
of Ireland in the following year. Having been mentioned as a
possible husband for Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold,
afterwards duke of Burgundy, Clarence came under the influence of
Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, and in July 1469 was married
at Calais to the earl&rsquo;s elder daughter Isabella. With his
father-in-law he then acted in a disloyal manner towards the king.
Both supported the rebels in the north of England, and when
their treachery was discovered Clarence was deprived of his
office as lord-lieutenant and fled to France. Returning to
England with Warwick in September 1470, he witnessed the
restoration of Henry VI., when the crown was settled upon
himself in case the male line of Henry&rsquo;s family became extinct.
The good understanding, however, between Warwick and his
son-in-law was not lasting, and Clarence was soon secretly
reconciled with Edward. The public reconciliation between
the brothers took place when the king was besieging Warwick
in Coventry, and Clarence then fought for the Yorkists at
Barnet and Tewkesbury. After Warwick&rsquo;s death in April 1471
Clarence appears to have seized the whole of the vast estates of
the earl, and in March 1472 was created by right of his wife earl
of Warwick and Salisbury. He was consequently greatly disturbed
when he heard that his younger brother Richard, duke of
Gloucester, was seeking to marry Warwick&rsquo;s younger daughter
Anne, and was claiming some part of Warwick&rsquo;s lands. A violent
quarrel between the brothers ensued, but Clarence was unable
to prevent Gloucester from marrying, and in 1474 the king
interfered to settle the dispute, dividing the estates between
his brothers. In 1477 Clarence was again a suitor for the hand
of Mary, who had just become duchess of Burgundy. Edward
objected to the match, and Clarence, jealous of Gloucester&rsquo;s
influence, left the court. At length Edward was convinced
that Clarence was aiming at his throne. The duke was thrown
into prison, and in January 1478 the king unfolded the charges
against his brother to the parliament. He had slandered the
king; had received oaths of allegiance to himself and his heirs;
had prepared for a new rebellion; and was in short incorrigible.
Both Houses of Parliament passed the bill of attainder, and the
sentence of death which followed was carried out on the 17th
or 18th of February 1478. It is uncertain what share Gloucester
had in his brother&rsquo;s death; but soon after the event the rumour
gained ground that Clarence had been drowned in a butt of
malmsey wine. Two of the duke&rsquo;s children survived their
father: Margaret, countess of Salisbury (1473-1541), and
Edward, earl of Warwick (1475-1499), who passed the greater
part of his life in prison and was beheaded in November 1499.</p>

English historian and statesman, son of Henry Hyde of Dinton,

Norbury, Cheshire, was born on the 18th of February 1609.
He entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1622 (having been refused
a demyship at Magdalen College), and graduated B.A. in 1626.
Intended originally for holy orders, the death of two elder
brothers made him his father&rsquo;s heir, and in 1625 he entered the
Middle Temple. At the university his abilities were more
conspicuous than his industry, and at the bar his time was
devoted more to general reading and to the society of eminent
scholars and writers than to the study of law treatises. This
wandering from the beaten track, however, was not without its
advantages. In later years Clarendon declared &ldquo;next the
immediate blessing and providence of God Almighty&rdquo; that he
&ldquo;owed all the little he knew and the little good that was in him
to the friendships and conversation  ... of the most excellent
men in their several kinds that lived in that age.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1i" id="FnAnchor_1i" href="#Footnote_1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> These
included Ben Jonson, Selden, Waller, Hales, and especially Lord
Falkland; and from their influence and the wide reading in
which he indulged, he doubtless drew the solid learning and
literary talent which afterwards distinguished him.</p>

<p>In 1629 he married his first wife, Anne, daughter of Sir George
Ayliffe, who died six months afterwards; and secondly, in 1634,
Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Aylesbury, Master of Requests.
In 1633 he was called to the bar, and obtained quickly a good
position and practice. His marriages had gained for him influential
friends, and in December 1634 he was made keeper of
the writs and rolls of the common pleas; while his able conduct
of the petition of the London merchants against Portland earned
Laud&rsquo;s approval. He was returned to the Short Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
in 1640 as member for Wootton Bassett. Respect and veneration
for the law and constitution of England were already
fundamental principles with Hyde, and the flagrant violations
and perversions of the law which characterized the twelve
preceding years of absolute rule drove him into the ranks of the
popular party. He served on numerous and important committees,
and his parliamentary action was directed chiefly towards
the support and restoration of the law. He assailed the
jurisdiction of the earl marshal&rsquo;s court, and in the Long Parliament,
in which he sat for Saltash, renewed his attacks and
practically effected its suppression. In 1641 he served on the
committees for inquiring into the status of the councils of Wales
and of the North, distinguished himself by a speech against the
latter, and took an important part in the proceedings against
the judges. He supported Stafford&rsquo;s impeachment, and did
not vote against the attainder, subsequently making an unsuccessful
attempt through Essex to avert the capital penalty.<a name="FnAnchor_2i" id="FnAnchor_2i" href="#Footnote_2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Hyde&rsquo;s allegiance, however, to the church of England was as
staunch as his support of the law, and was soon to separate
him from the popular faction. In February 1641 he opposed
the reception of the London petition against episcopacy, and in
May the project for unity of religion with the Scots, and the bill
for the exclusion of the clergy from secular office. He showed
special energy in his opposition to the Root and Branch Bill,
and, though made chairman of the committee on the bill on the
11th of July in order to silence his opposition, he caused by his
successful obstruction the failure of the measure. In consequence
he was summoned to the king&rsquo;s presence, and encouraged in his
attitude, and at the beginning of the second session was regarded
as one of the king&rsquo;s ablest supporters in the Commons. He
considered the claims put forward at this time by parliament
as a violation and not as a guarantee of the law and constitution.
He opposed the demand by the parliament to choose the king&rsquo;s
ministers, and also the Grand Remonstrance, to which he wrote
a reply published by the king.</p>

<p>He now definitely though not openly joined the royal cause,
and refused office in January 1642 with Colepeper and Falkland
in order to serve the king&rsquo;s interests more effectually. Charles
undertook to do nothing in the Commons without their advice.
Nevertheless a few days afterwards, without their knowledge and
by the advice of Lord Digby, he attempted the arrest of the five
members, a resort to force which reduced Hyde to despair, and
which indeed seemed to show that things had gone too far for an
appeal to the law. He persevered, nevertheless, in his legal policy,
to which Charles after the failure of his project again returned,
joined the king openly in June, and continued to compose the
king&rsquo;s answers and declarations in which he appealed to the
&ldquo;known Laws of the land&rdquo; against the arbitrary and illegal
acts of a seditious majority in the parliament, his advice to the
king being &ldquo;to shelter himself wholly under the law,... presuming
that the king and the law together would have been
strong enough for any encounter.&rdquo; Hyde&rsquo;s appeal had great
influence, and gained for the king&rsquo;s cause half the nation. It by no
means, however, met with universal support among the royalists,
Hobbes jeering at Hyde&rsquo;s love for &ldquo;mixed monarchy,&rdquo; and the
courtiers expressing their disapproval of the &ldquo;spirit of accommodation&rdquo;
which &ldquo;wounded the regality.&rdquo; It was destined to
failure owing principally to the invincible distrust of Charles
created in the parliament leaders, and to the fact that Charles was
simultaneously carrying on another and an inconsistent policy,
listening to very different advisers, such as the queen and Digby,
and resolving on measures (such as the attempt on Hull) without
Hyde&rsquo;s knowledge or approval.</p>

<p>War, accordingly, in spite of his efforts, broke out. He was
expelled the House of Commons on the 11th of August 1642, and
was one of those excepted later from pardon. He showed great
activity in collecting loans, was present at Edgehill, though not as
a combatant, and followed the king to Oxford, residing at All
Souls College from October 1642 till March 1645. On the 22nd of
February he was made a privy councillor and knighted, and on
the 3rd of March appointed chancellor of the exchequer. He
was an influential member of the &ldquo;Junto&rdquo; which met every
week to discuss business before it was laid before the council.
His aim was to gain over some of the leading Parliamentarians
by personal influence and personal considerations, and at the
Uxbridge negotiations in January 1645, where he acted as
principal manager on the king&rsquo;s side, while remaining firm on the
great political questions such as the church and the militia, he
tried to win individuals by promises of places and honours. He
promoted the assembly of the Oxford parliament in December
1643 as a counterpoise to the influence and status of the Long
Parliament. Hyde&rsquo;s policy and measures, however, all failed.
They had been weakly and irregularly supported by the king, and
were fiercely opposed by the military party, who were jealous of
the civil influence, and were urging Charles to trust to force and
arms alone and eschew all compromise and concessions. Charles
fell now under the influence of persons devoid of all legal and
constitutional scruples, sending to Glamorgan in Ireland &ldquo;those
strange powers and instructions inexcusable to justice, piety and
prudence.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_3i" id="FnAnchor_3i" href="#Footnote_3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>Hyde&rsquo;s influence was much diminished, and on the 4th of March
1645 he left the king for Bristol as one of the guardians of the
prince of Wales and governors of the west. Here the disputes
between the council and the army paralysed the proceedings, and
lost, according to Hyde, the finest opportunity since the outbreak
of the war of raising a strong force and gaining substantial
victories in that part of the country. After Hopton&rsquo;s defeat on
the 16th of February 1646, at Torrington, Hyde accompanied the
prince, on the 4th of March, to Scilly, and on the 17th of April, for
greater security, to Jersey. He strongly disapproved of the
prince&rsquo;s removal to France by the queen&rsquo;s order and of the
schemes of assistance from abroad, refused to accompany him,
and signed a bond to prevent the sale of Jersey to the French
supported by Jermyn. He opposed the projected sacrifice of the
church to the Scots and the grant by the king of any but personal
or temporary concessions, declaring that peace was only possible
&ldquo;upon the old foundations of government in church and state.&rdquo;
He was especially averse to Charles&rsquo;s tampering with the Irish
Romanists. &ldquo;Oh, Mr Secretary,&rdquo; he wrote to Nicholas, &ldquo;those
stratagems have given me more sad hours than all the misfortunes
in war which have befallen the king and look like the
effects of God&rsquo;s anger towards us.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4i" id="FnAnchor_4i" href="#Footnote_4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a> He refused to compound for
his own estate. While in Jersey he resided first at St Helier and
afterwards at Elizabeth Castle with Sir George Carteret. He
composed the first portion of his <i>History</i> and kept in touch with
events by means of an enormous correspondence. In 1648 he
published <i>A Full answer to an infamous and traiterous Pamphlet...</i>,
a reply to the resolution of the parliament to present no
more addresses to the king and a vindication of Charles.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the second Civil War Hyde left Jersey
(26th of June 1648) to join the queen and prince at Paris. He
landed at Dieppe, sailed from that port to Dunkirk, and thence
followed the prince to the Thames, where Charles had met the
fleet, but was captured and robbed by a privateer, and only joined
the prince in September after the latter&rsquo;s return to the Hague.
He strongly disapproved of the king&rsquo;s concessions at Newport.
When the army broke off the treaty and brought Charles to trial
he endeavoured to save his life, and after the execution drew up a
letter to the several European sovereigns invoking their assistance
to avenge it. Hyde strongly opposed Charles II.&rsquo;s ignominious
surrender to the Covenanters, the alliance with the Scots, and
the Scottish expedition, desiring to accomplish whatever was
possible there through Montrose and the royalists, and inclined
rather to an attempt in Ireland. His advice was not followed, and
he gladly accepted a mission with Cottington to Spain to obtain
money from the Roman Catholic powers, and to arrange an
alliance between Owen O&rsquo;Neill and Ormonde for the recovery of
Ireland, arriving at Madrid on the 26th of November 1649. The
defeat, however, of Charles at Dunbar, and the confirmation of
Cromwell&rsquo;s ascendancy, influenced the Spanish government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
against them, and they were ordered to leave in December 1650.
Hyde arrived at Antwerp in January 1651, and in December
rejoined Charles at Paris after the latter&rsquo;s escape from Worcester.
He now became one of his chief advisers, accompanying him in
his change of residence to Cologne in October 1654 and to
Bruges in 1658, and was appointed lord chancellor on the 13th
of January 1658. His influence was henceforth maintained in
spite of the intrigues of both Romanists and Presbyterians, as
well as the violent and openly displayed hostility of the queen,
and was employed unremittingly in the endeavour to keep
Charles faithful to the church and constitution, and in the prevention
of unwise concessions and promises which might estrange
the general body of the royalists. His advice to Charles was to
wait upon the turn of events, &ldquo;that all his activity was to
consist in carefully avoiding to do anything that might do him
hurt and to expect some blessed conjuncture.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_5i" id="FnAnchor_5i" href="#Footnote_5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a> In 1656, during
the war between England and Spain, Charles received offers of
help from the latter power provided he could gain a port in
England, but Hyde discouraged small isolated attempts. He
expected much from Cromwell&rsquo;s death. The same year he made
an alliance with the Levellers, and was informed of their plots to
assassinate the protector, without apparently expressing any
disapproval.<a name="FnAnchor_6i" id="FnAnchor_6i" href="#Footnote_6i"><span class="sp">6</span></a> He was well supplied with information from
England,<a name="FnAnchor_7i" id="FnAnchor_7i" href="#Footnote_7i"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and guided the action of the royalists with great
ability and wisdom during the interval between Cromwell&rsquo;s
death and the Restoration, urged patience, and advocated the
obstruction of a settlement between the factions contending for
power and the fomentation of their jealousies, rather than
premature risings.</p>

<p>The Restoration was a complete triumph for Hyde&rsquo;s policy.
He lays no stress on his own great part in it, but it was owing
to him that the Restoration was a national one, by the consent
and invitation of parliament representing the whole people
and not through the medium of one powerful faction enforcing
its will upon a minority, and that it was not only a restoration
of Charles but a restoration of the monarchy. By Hyde&rsquo;s
advice concessions to the inconvenient demands of special
factions had been avoided by referring the decision to a &ldquo;free
parliament,&rdquo; and the declaration of Breda reserved for parliament
the settlement of the questions of amnesty, religious
toleration and the proprietorship of forfeited lands.</p>

<p>Hyde entered London with the king, all attempts at effecting
his fall having failed, and immediately obtained the chief place
in the government, retaining the chancellorship of the exchequer
till the 13th of May 1661, when he surrendered it to Lord Ashley.
He took his seat as speaker of the House of Lords and in the
court of chancery on the 1st of June 1660. On the 3rd of
November 1660 he was made Baron Hyde of Hindon, and on
the 20th of April 1661 Viscount Cornbury and earl of Clarendon,
receiving a grant from the king of £20,000 and at different times
of various small estates and Irish rents. The marriage of his
daughter Anne to James, duke of York, celebrated in secret in
September 1660, at first alarmed Clarendon on account of the
public hostility he expected thereby to incur, but finding his
fears unconfirmed he acquiesced in its public recognition in
December, and thus became related in a special manner to the
royal family and the grandfather of two English sovereigns.<a name="FnAnchor_8i" id="FnAnchor_8i" href="#Footnote_8i"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>Clarendon&rsquo;s position was one of great difficulties, but at the
same time of splendid opportunities. In particular a rare
occasion now offered itself of settling the religious question on a
broad principle of comprehension or toleration; for the monarchy
had been restored not by the supporters of the church alone
but largely by the influence and aid of the nonconformists and
also of the Roman Catholics, who were all united at that happy
moment by a common loyalty to the throne. Clarendon appears
to have approved of comprehension but not of toleration. He
had already in April 1660 sent to discuss terms with the leading
Presbyterians in England, and after the Restoration offered
bishoprics to several, including Richard Baxter. He drew up
the royal declaration of October, promising limited episcopacy
and a revised prayer-book and ritual, which was subsequently
thrown out by parliament, and he appears to have anticipated
some kind of settlement from the Savoy Conference which sat
in April 1661. The failure of the latter proved perhaps that the
differences were too great for compromise, and widened the
breach. The parliament immediately proceeded to pass the
series of narrow and tyrannical measures against the dissenters
known as the Clarendon Code. The Corporations Act, obliging
members of corporations to denounce the Covenant and take
the sacrament according to the Anglican usage, became law
on the 20th of December 1661, the Act of Uniformity enforcing
the use of the prayer-book on ministers, as well as a declaration
that it was unlawful to bear arms against the sovereign, on the
19th of May 1662, and these were followed by the Conventicle Act
in 1664 suppressing conventicles and by the Five-Mile Act in 1665
forbidding ministers who had refused subscription to the Act of
Uniformity to teach or reside within 5 m. of a borough. Clarendon
appears to have reluctantly acquiesced in these civil measures
rather than to have originated them, and to have endeavoured
to mitigate their injustice and severity. He supported the continuance
of the tenure by presbyterian ministers of livings not
held by Anglicans and an amendment in the Lords allowing a
pension to those deprived, earning the gratitude of Baxter and
the nonconformists. On the 17th of March 1662 he introduced
into parliament a declaration enabling the king to dispense
with the Act of Uniformity in the case of ministers of merit.<a name="FnAnchor_9i" id="FnAnchor_9i" href="#Footnote_9i"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
But once committed to the narrow policy of intolerance, Clarendon
was inevitably involved in all its consequences. His characteristic
respect for the law and constitution rendered him
hostile to the general policy of indulgence, which, though the
favourite project of the king, he strongly opposed in the Lords,
and in the end caused its withdrawal. He declared that he could
have wished the law otherwise, &ldquo;but when it was passed, he
thought it absolutely necessary to see obedience paid to it
without any connivance.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_10i" id="FnAnchor_10i" href="#Footnote_10i"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Charles was greatly angered. It
was believed in May 1663 that the intrigues of Bennet and
Buckingham, who seized the opportunity of ingratiating themselves
with the king by zealously supporting the indulgence,
had secured Clarendon&rsquo;s dismissal, and in July Bristol ventured
to accuse him of high treason in the parliament; but the attack,
which did not receive the king&rsquo;s support, failed entirely and only
ended in the banishment from court of its promoter. Clarendon&rsquo;s
opposition to the court policy in this way acquired a personal
character, and he was compelled to identify himself more completely
with the intolerant measures of the House of Commons.
Though not the originator of the Conventicle Act or of the Five-Mile
Act, he has recorded his approval,<a name="FnAnchor_11i" id="FnAnchor_11i" href="#Footnote_11i"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and he ended by taking
alarm at plots and rumours and by regarding the great party
of nonconformists, through whose co-operation the monarchy
had been restored, as a danger to the state whose &ldquo;faction was
their religion.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_12i" id="FnAnchor_12i" href="#Footnote_12i"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Clarendon&rsquo;s influence and direction had been
predominant in nearly all departments of state. He supported
the exception of the actual regicides from the Indemnity, but
only ten out of the twenty-six condemned were executed, and
Clarendon, with the king&rsquo;s support, prevented the passing of a
bill in 1661 for the execution of thirteen more. He upheld the
Act of Indemnity against all the attempts of the royalists to
upset it. The conflicting claims to estates were left to be decided
by the law. The confiscations of the usurping government accordingly
were cancelled, while the properly executed transactions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
between individuals were necessarily upheld. There can be
little doubt that the principle followed was the only safe
one in the prevailing confusion. Great injustice was indeed
suffered by individuals, but the proper remedy of such injustice
was the benevolence of the king, which there is too much reason
to believe proved inadequate and partial. The settlement of
the church lands which was directed by Clarendon presented
equal difficulties and involved equal hardships. In settling
Scotland Clarendon&rsquo;s aim was to make that kingdom dependent
upon England and to uphold the Cromwellian union. He
proposed to establish a council at Whitehall to govern Scottish
affairs, and showed great zeal in endeavouring to restore episcopacy
through the medium of Archbishop Sharp. His influence,
however, ended with the ascendancy of Lauderdale in 1663.
He was, to some extent at least, responsible for the settlement
in Ireland, but, while anxious for an establishment upon a
solid Protestant basis, urged &ldquo;temper and moderation and
justice&rdquo; in securing it. He supported Ormonde&rsquo;s wise and
enlightened Irish administration, and in particular opposed
persistently the prohibition of the import of Irish cattle into
England, incurring thereby great unpopularity. He showed
great activity in the advancement of the colonies, to whom he
allowed full freedom of religion. He was a member of the council
for foreign plantations, and one of the eight lords proprietors
of Carolina in 1663; and in 1664 sent a commission to settle
disputes in New England. In the department of foreign
affairs he had less influence. His policy was limited to the
maintenance of peace &ldquo;necessary for the reducing [the king&rsquo;s]
own dominions into that temper of subjection and obedience
as they ought to be in.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_13i" id="FnAnchor_13i" href="#Footnote_13i"><span class="sp">13</span></a> In 1664 he demanded, on behalf
of Charles, French support, and a loan of £50,000 against disturbance
at home, and thus initiated that ignominious system
of pensions and dependence upon France which proved so
injurious to English interests later. But he was the promoter
neither of the sale of Dunkirk on the 27th of October 1662, the
author of which seems to have been the earl of Sandwich,<a name="FnAnchor_14i" id="FnAnchor_14i" href="#Footnote_14i"><span class="sp">14</span></a> nor
of the Dutch War. He attached considerable value to the
possession of the former, but when its sale was decided he conducted
the negotiations and effected the bargain. He had
zealously laboured for peace with Holland, and had concluded
a treaty for the settlement of disputes on the 4th of September
1662. Commercial and naval jealousies, however, soon involved
the two states in hostilities. Cape Corso and other Dutch
possessions on the <span class="correction" title="amended from cost">coast</span> of Africa, and New Amsterdam in
America, were seized by squadrons from the royal navy in 1664,
and hostilities were declared on the 22nd of February 1665.
Clarendon now gave his support to the war, asserted the extreme
claims of the English crown over the British seas, and contemplated
fresh cessions from the Dutch and an alliance with Sweden
and Spain. According to his own account he initiated the policy
of the Triple Alliance,<a name="FnAnchor_15i" id="FnAnchor_15i" href="#Footnote_15i"><span class="sp">15</span></a> but it seems clear that his inclination
towards France continued in spite of the intervention of the
latter state in favour of Holland; and he took part in the
negotiations for ending the war by an undertaking with Louis
XIV. implying a neutrality, while the latter seized Flanders.
The crisis in this feeble foreign policy and in the general official
mismanagement was reached in June 1667, when the Dutch
burnt several ships at Chatham and when &ldquo;the roar of foreign
guns were heard for the first and last time by the citizens of
London.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_16i" id="FnAnchor_16i" href="#Footnote_16i"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>The whole responsibility for the national calamity and disgrace,
and for the ignominious peace which followed it, was unjustly
thrown on the shoulders of Clarendon, though it must be admitted
that the disjointed state of the administration and want of
control over foreign policy were largely the causes of the disaster,
and for these Clarendon&rsquo;s influence and obstruction of official
reforms were to some extent answerable. According to Sir
William Coventry, whose opinion has weight and who acknowledges
the chancellor&rsquo;s fidelity to the king, while Clarendon &ldquo;was
so great at the council board and in the administration of matters,
there was no room for anybody to propose any remedy to what
was remiss ... he managing all things with that greatness which
will now be removed.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_17i" id="FnAnchor_17i" href="#Footnote_17i"><span class="sp">17</span></a> He disapproved of the system of boards
and committees instituted during the Commonwealth, as giving
too much power to the parliament, and regarded the administration
by the great officers of state, to the exclusion of pure men of
business, as the only method compatible with the dignity and
security of the monarchy. The lowering of the prestige of the
privy council, and its subordination first to the parliament and
afterwards to the military faction, he considered as one of the
chief causes of the fall of Charles I. He aroused a strong feeling of
hostility in the Commons by his opposition to the appropriation of
supplies in 1665, and to the audit of the war accounts in 1666, as
&ldquo;an introduction to a commonwealth&rdquo; and as &ldquo;a new encroachment,&rdquo;
and by his high tone of prerogative and authority, while
by his advice to Charles to prorogue parliament he incurred their
resentment and gave colour to the accusation that he had advised
the king to govern without parliaments. He was unpopular
among all classes, among the royalists on account of the Act
of Indemnity, among the Presbyterians because of the Act of
Uniformity. It was said that he had invented the maxim &ldquo;that
the king should buy and reward his enemies and do little for his
friends, because they are his already.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_18i" id="FnAnchor_18i" href="#Footnote_18i"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Every kind of maladministration
was currently ascribed to him, of designs to govern
by a standing army, and of corruption. He was credited with
having married Charles purposely to a barren queen in order to
raise his own grandchildren to the throne, with having sold
Dunkirk to France, and his magnificent house in St James&rsquo;s was
nicknamed &ldquo;Dunkirk House,&rdquo; while on the day of the Dutch
attack on Chatham the mob set up a gibbet at his gate and broke
his windows. He had always been exceedingly unpopular at
court, and kept severely aloof from the revels and licence which
reigned there. Evelyn names &ldquo;the buffoons and the misses to
whom he was an eyesore.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_19i" id="FnAnchor_19i" href="#Footnote_19i"><span class="sp">19</span></a> He was intensely disliked by the
royal mistresses, whose favour he did not condescend to seek, and
whose presence and influence were often the subject of his
reproaches.<a name="FnAnchor_20i" id="FnAnchor_20i" href="#Footnote_20i"><span class="sp">20</span></a> A party of younger men of the king&rsquo;s own age,
more congenial to his temperament, and eager to drive the old
chancellor from power and to succeed him in office, had for some
time been endeavouring to undermine his influence by ridicule and
intrigue. Surrounded by such general and violent animosity,
Clarendon&rsquo;s only hope could be in the support of the king. But
the chancellor had early and accurately gauged the nature and
extent of the king&rsquo;s attachment to him, which proceeded neither
from affection nor gratitude but &ldquo;from his aversion to be
troubled with the intricacies of his affairs,&rdquo; and in 1661 he had
resisted the importunities of Ormonde to resign the great seal for
the lord treasurership with the rank of &ldquo;first minister,&rdquo; &ldquo;a title
newly translated out of French into English,&rdquo; on account of the
obloquy this position would incur and the further dependence
which it entailed upon the inconstant king.<a name="FnAnchor_21i" id="FnAnchor_21i" href="#Footnote_21i"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Charles, long weary
of the old chancellor&rsquo;s rebukes, was especially incensed at this
time owing to his failure in securing Frances Stuart (la Belle
Stuart) for his seraglio, a disappointment which he attributed to
Clarendon, and was now alarmed by the hostility which his
administration had excited. He did not scruple to sacrifice at
once the old adherent of his house and fortunes. &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo;
he wrote Ormonde, &ldquo;his behaviour and humour was grown so
insupportable to myself and all the world else that I could no
longer endure it, and it was impossible for me to live with it and
do these things with the Parliament that must be done, or the
government will be lost.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_22i" id="FnAnchor_22i" href="#Footnote_22i"><span class="sp">22</span></a> By the direction of Charles, James
advised Clarendon to resign before the meeting of parliament, but
in an interview with the king on the 26th of August Clarendon
refused to deliver up the seal unless dismissed, and urged him not
to take a step ruinous to the interests both of the chancellor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
himself and of the crown.<a name="FnAnchor_23i" id="FnAnchor_23i" href="#Footnote_23i"><span class="sp">23</span></a> He could not believe his dismissal was
really intended, but on the 30th of August he was deprived of the
great seal, for which the king received the thanks of the parliament
on the 16th of October. On the 12th of November his impeachment,
consisting of various charges of arbitrary government,
corruption and maladministration, was brought up to the Lords,
but the latter refused to order his committal, on the ground that
the Commons had only accused him of treason in general without
specifying any particular charge. Clarendon wrote humbly to
the king asking for pardon, and that the prosecution might be
prevented, but Charles had openly taken part against him, and,
though desiring his escape, would not order or assist his departure
for fear of the Commons. Through the bishop of Hereford,
however, on the 29th of November he pressed Clarendon to fly,
promising that he should not during his absence suffer in his
honour or fortune. Clarendon embarked the same night for
Calais, where he arrived on the 2nd of December. The Lords
immediately passed an act for his banishment and ordered the
petition forwarded by him to parliament to be burnt.</p>

<p>The rest of Clarendon&rsquo;s life was passed in exile. He left
Calais for Rouen on the 25th of December, returning on the
21st of January 1668, visiting the baths of Bourbon in April,
thence to Avignon in June, residing from July 1668 till June
1671 at Montpellier, whence he proceeded to Moulins and to
Rouen again in May 1674. His sudden banishment entailed
great personal hardships. His health at the time of his flight
was much impaired, and on arriving at Calais he fell dangerously
ill; and Louis XIV., anxious at this time to gain popularity
in England, sent him peremptory and repeated orders to quit
France. He suffered severely from gout, and during the greater
part of his exile could not walk without the aid of two men.
At Evreux, on the 23rd of April 1668, he was the victim of a
murderous assault by English sailors, who attributed to him the
non-payment of their wages, and who were on the point of
despatching him when he was rescued by the guard. For some
time he was not allowed to see any of his children; even correspondence
with him was rendered treasonable by the Act of
Banishment; and it was not apparently till 1671, 1673 and 1674
that he received visits from his sons, the younger, Lawrence
Hyde, being present with him at his death.</p>

<p>Clarendon bore his troubles with great dignity and fortitude.
He found consolation in religious duties, and devoted a portion
of every day to the composition of his <i>Contemplations on the
Psalms</i>, and of his moral essays. Removed effectually from
the public scene, and from all share in present politics, he turned
his attention once more to the past and finished his <i>History</i> and
his <i>Autobiography</i>. Soon after reaching Calais he had written,
on the 17th of December 1667, to the university of Oxford,
desiring as his last request that the university should believe
in his innocence and remember him, though there could be no
further mention of him in their public devotions, in their private
prayers.<a name="FnAnchor_24i" id="FnAnchor_24i" href="#Footnote_24i"><span class="sp">24</span></a> In 1668 he wrote to the duke and duchess of York to
remonstrate on the report that they had turned Roman Catholic,
to the former urging &ldquo;You cannot be without zeal for the
Church to which your blessed father made himself a sacrifice,&rdquo;
adding that such a change would bring a great storm against
the Romanists. He entertained to the last hopes of obtaining
leave to return to England. He asked for permission in June
1671 and in August 1674. In the dedication of his <i>Brief View
of Mr Hobbes&rsquo;s Book Leviathan</i> he repeats &ldquo;the hope which
sustains my weak, decayed spirits that your Majesty will at
some time call to your remembrance my long and incorrupted
fidelity to your person and your service&rdquo;; but his petitions
were not even answered or noticed. He died at Rouen on the
9th of December 1674. He was buried in Westminster Abbey
at the foot of the steps at the entrance to Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel.
He left two sons, Henry, 2nd earl of Clarendon, and Lawrence,
earl of Rochester, his daughter Anne, duchess of York, and a
third son, Edward, having predeceased him. His male descendants
became extinct on the death of the 4th earl of Clarendon
and 2nd earl of Rochester in 1753, the title of Clarendon being
revived in 1776 in the person of Thomas Villiers, who had
married the granddaughter and heir of the last earl.</p>

<p>As a statesman Clarendon had obvious limitations and failings.
He brought to the consideration of political questions an essentially
legal but also a narrow mind, conceiving the law, &ldquo;that
great and admirable mystery,&rdquo; and the constitution as fixed,
unchangeable and sufficient for all time, in contrast to Pym,
who regarded them as living organisms capable of continual
development and evolution; and he was incapable of comprehending
and governing the new conditions and forces created
by the civil wars. His character, however, and therefore to
some extent his career, bear the indelible marks of greatness.
He left the popular cause at the moment of its triumph and
showed in so doing a strict consistency. In a court degraded
by licence and self-indulgence, he maintained his self-respect
and personal dignity regardless of consequences, and in an age
of almost universal corruption and self-seeking he preserved a
noble integrity and patriotism. At the Restoration he showed
great moderation in accepting rewards. He refused a grant
of 10,000 acres in the Fens from the king on the ground that
it would create an evil precedent, and amused Charles and James
by his indignation at the offer of a present of £10,000 from the
French minister Fouquet, the only present he accepted from
Louis XIV. being a set of books printed at the Louvre. His
income, however, as lord chancellor was very large, and Clarendon
maintained considerable state, considering it due to the dignity
of the monarchy that the high officers should carry the external
marks of greatness. The house built by him in St James&rsquo;s
was one of the most magnificent ever seen in England, and was
filled with a collection of portraits, chiefly those of contemporary
statesmen and men of letters. It cost Clarendon £50,000, involved
him deeply in debt and was considered one of the chief
causes of the &ldquo;gust of envy&rdquo; that caused his fall.<a name="FnAnchor_25i" id="FnAnchor_25i" href="#Footnote_25i"><span class="sp">25</span></a> He is
described as &ldquo;a fair, ruddy, fat, middle-statured, handsome
man,&rdquo; and his appearance was stately and dignified. He
expected deference from his inferiors, and one of the chief
charges which he brought against the party of the young politicians
was the want of respect with which they treated himself
and the lord treasurer. His industry and devotion to public
business, of which proofs still remain in the enormous mass of his
state papers and correspondence, were exemplary, and were
rendered all the more conspicuous by the negligence, inferiority
in business, and frivolity of his successors. As lord chancellor
Clarendon made no great impression in the court of chancery.
His early legal training had long been interrupted, and his
political preoccupations probably rendered necessary the
delegation of many of his judicial duties to others. According
to Speaker Onslow his decrees were always made with the aid
of two judges. Burnet praises him, however, as &ldquo;a very good
chancellor, only a little too rough but very impartial in the
administration of justice,&rdquo; and Pepys, who saw him presiding
in his court, perceived him to be &ldquo;a most able and ready man.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_26i" id="FnAnchor_26i" href="#Footnote_26i"><span class="sp">26</span></a>
According to Evelyn, &ldquo;though no considerable lawyer&rdquo; he was
&ldquo;one who kept up the fame and substance of things in the
nation with ... solemnity.&rdquo; He made good appointments
to the bench and issued some important orders for the reform
of abuses in his court.<a name="FnAnchor_27i" id="FnAnchor_27i" href="#Footnote_27i"><span class="sp">27</span></a> As chancellor of Oxford University,
to which office he was elected on the 27th of October 1660,
Clarendon promoted the restoration of order and various educational
reforms. In 1753 his manuscripts were left to the university
by his great-grandson Lord Cornbury, and in 1868 the
money gained by publication was spent in erecting the Clarendon
Laboratory, the profits of the <i>History</i> having provided in 1713
a building for the university press adjoining the Sheldonian
theatre, known since the removal of the press to its present
quarters as the Clarendon Building.</p>

<p>Clarendon had risen to high office largely through his literary
and oratorical gifts. His eloquence was greatly admired by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
Evelyn and Pepys, though Burnet criticises it as too copious.
He was a great lover of books and collected a large library, was
well read in the Roman and in the contemporary histories both
foreign and English, and could appreciate Carew, Ben Jonson and
Cowley. As a writer and historian Clarendon occupies a high
place in English literature. His great work, the <i>History of the
Rebellion</i>, is composed in the grand style. A characteristic
feature is the wonderful series of well-known portraits, drawn
with great skill and liveliness and especially praised by Evelyn
and by Macaulay. The long digressions, the lengthy sentences,
and the numerous parentheses do not accord with modern taste
and usage, but it may be observed that these often follow more
closely the natural involutions of the thought, and express the
argument more clearly, than the short disconnected sentences,
now generally employed, while in rhythm and dignity Clarendon&rsquo;s
style is immeasurably superior. The composition, however, of
the work as a whole is totally wanting in proportion, and the
book is overloaded with state papers, misplaced and tedious in the
narrative. In considering the accuracy of the history it is
important to remember the dates and circumstances of the
composition of its various portions. The published <i>History</i> is
mainly a compilation of two separate original manuscripts, the
first being the history proper, written between 1646 and 1648,
with the advantage of a fresh memory and the help of various
documents and authorities, and ending in March 1644, and the
second being the <i>Life</i>, extending from 1609 to 1660, but composed
long afterwards in exile and without the aid of papers between
1668 and 1670. The value of any statement, therefore, in the
published <i>History</i> depends chiefly on whether it is taken from the
<i>History</i> proper or the <i>Life</i>. In 1671 these two manuscripts were
united by Clarendon with certain alterations and modifications
making Books i.-vii. of the published <i>History</i>, while Books viii.-xv.
were written subsequently, and, being composed for the most
part without materials, are generally inaccurate, with the notable
exception of Book ix., made up from two narratives written at
Jersey in 1646, and containing very little from the <i>Life</i>. Sincerity
and honest conviction are present on every page, and the inaccuracies
are due not to wilful misrepresentation, but to failure
of memory and to the disadvantages under which the author
laboured in exile. But they lessen considerably the value of his
work, and detract from his reputation as chronicler of contemporary
events, for which he was specially fitted by his
practical experience in public business, a qualification declared
by himself to be the &ldquo;genius, spirit and soul of an historian.&rdquo;
In general, Clarendon, like many of his contemporaries, failed
signally to comprehend the real issues and principles at stake in
the great struggle, laying far too much stress on personalities
and never understanding the real aims and motives of the
Presbyterian party. The work was first published in 1702-1704
from a copy of a transcript made by Clarendon&rsquo;s secretary, with
a few unimportant alterations, and was the object of a violent
attack by John Oldmixon for supposed changes and omissions
in <i>Clarendon and Whitelocke compared</i> (1727) and again in a
preface to his <i>History of England</i> (1730), repelled and refuted by
John Burton in the <i>Genuineness of Lord Clarendon&rsquo;s History
Vindicated</i> (1744). The history was first published from the
original in 1826; the best edition being that of 1888 edited by
W.D. Macray and issued by the Clarendon Press. <i>The Lord
Clarendon&rsquo;s History ... Compleated</i>, a supplement containing
portraits and illustrative papers, was published in 1717, and <i>An
Appendix to the History</i>, containing a life, speeches and various
pieces, in 1724. The <i>Sutherland Clarendon</i> in the Bodleian
library at Oxford contains several thousand portraits and
illustrations of the <i>History</i>. <i>The Life of Edward, earl of Clarendon</i>
... [<i>and the</i>] <i>Continuation of the History ... </i>, the first consisting
of that portion of the <i>Life</i> not included in the <i>History</i>, and the
second of the account of Clarendon&rsquo;s administration and exile in
France, begun in 1672, was published in 1759, the <i>History of the
Reign of King Charles II. from the Restoration ...</i>, published
about 1755, being a surreptitious edition of this work, of which
the latest and best edition is that of the Clarendon Press of 1857.</p>

<p>Clarendon was also the author of <i>The Difference and Disparity
between the Estate and Condition of George, duke of Buckingham
and Robert, earl of Essex</i>, a youthful production vindicating
Buckingham, printed in <i>Reliquiae Wottonianae</i> (1672), i. 184;
<i>Animadversions on a Book entitled Fanaticism</i> (1673); <i>A Brief
View ... of the dangerous ... errors in ... Mr Hobbes&rsquo;s
book entitled &ldquo;Leviathan&rdquo;</i> (1676); <i>The History of the Rebellion
and Civil War in Ireland</i> (1719); <i>A Collection of Several Pieces of
Edward, earl of Clarendon</i>, containing reprints of speeches from
the journals of the House of Lords and of the History of the
Rebellion in Ireland (1727); <i>A Collection of Several Tracts</i>
containing his <i>Vindication</i> in answer to his impeachment,
<i>Reflections upon several Christian Duties, Two Dialogues on
Education and on the want of Respect due to age</i>, and <i>Contemplations
on the Psalms</i> (1727); <i>Religion and Policy</i> (1811); <i>Essays
moral and entertaining on the various faculties and passions of the
human mind</i> (1815, and in <i>British Prose Writers</i>, 1819, vol. i.);
<i>Speeches</i> in <i>Rushworth&rsquo;s Collections</i> (1692), pt. iii. vol. i. 230,
333; <i>Declarations and Manifestos</i> (Clarendon being the author of
nearly all on the king&rsquo;s side between March 1642 and March 1645,
the first being the answer to the Grand Remonstrance in January
1642, but not of the answer to the XIX. Propositions or the
apology for the King&rsquo;s attack upon Brentford) in the published
<i>History</i>, Rushworth&rsquo;s <i>Collections</i>, E. Husband&rsquo;s <i>Collections of
Ordinances and Declarations</i> (1646), <i>Old Parliamentary History</i>
(1751-1762), <i>Somers Tracts, State Tracts, Harleian Miscellany,
Thomasson Tracts</i> (Brit. Mus.), E. 157 (14); and a large number of
anonymous pamphlets aimed against the parliament, including
<i>Transcendent and Multiplied Rebellion and Treason</i> (1645), <i>A
Letter from a True and Lawful Member of Parliament ... to one
of the Lords of his Highness&rsquo;s Council</i> (1656), and <i>Two Speeches
made in the House of Peers on Monday 19th Dec.</i> [1642] ...
(<i>Somers Tracts</i>, Scott, vi. 576); <i>Second Thoughts</i> (n.d., in favour
of a limited toleration) is ascribed to him in the Catalogue in the
British Museum; <i>A Letter ... to one of the Chief Ministers of
the Nonconforming Party</i> ... (Saumur, 7th May 1674) has been
attributed to him on insufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Clarendon&rsquo;s correspondence, amounting to over 100 volumes,
is in the Bodleian library at Oxford, and other letters are to be
found in <i>Additional MSS.</i> in the British Museum. Selections
have been published under the title of <i>State Papers Collected by
Edward, earl of Clarendon</i> (Clarendon State Papers) between 1767
and 1786, and the collection has been calendared up to 1657 in
1869, 1872, 1876. Other letters of Clarendon are to be found in
Lister&rsquo;s <i>Life of Clarendon, iii.; Nicholas Papers</i> (Camden Soc.,
1886); <i>Diary</i> of J. Evelyn, <i>appendix</i>; Sir R. Fanshaw&rsquo;s <i>Original

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARENDON, GEORGE WILLIAM FREDERICK VILLIERS<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span>,
<span class="sc">4th Earl of</span> (in the Villiers line) (1800-1870), English diplomatist
and statesman, was born in London on the 12th of January 1800.
He was the eldest son of Hon. George Villiers (1750-1827),
youngest son of the 1st earl of Clarendon (second creation), by
Theresa, only daughter of the first Lord Boringdon, and
granddaughter of the first Lord Grantham. The earldom of the lord
chancellor Clarendon became extinct in the Hyde line by the
death of the 4th earl, his last male descendant. Jane Hyde,
countess of Essex, the sister of that nobleman (she died in 1724),
left two daughters; of these the eldest, Lady Charlotte, became
heiress of the Hyde family. She married Thomas Villiers (1709-1786),
second son of the 2nd earl of Jersey, who served with
distinction as English minister in Germany, and in 1776 the
earldom of Clarendon was revived in his favour. The connexion
with the Hyde family was therefore in the female line and
somewhat remote. But a portion of the pictures and plate of the
great chancellor was preserved to this branch of the family, and
remains at The Grove, their family seat at Hertfordshire. The
2nd and 3rd earls were sons of the 1st, and, neither of them
having sons, the title passed, on the death of the 3rd earl (John
Charles) in 1838, to their younger brother&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>Young George Villiers entered upon life in circumstances
which gave small promise of the brilliancy of his future career.
He was well born; he was heir presumptive to an earldom;
and his mother was a woman of great energy, admirable good
sense, and high feeling. But the means of his family were
contracted; his education was desultory and incomplete; he
had not the advantages of a training either at a public school or
in the House of Commons. He went up to Cambridge at the
early age of sixteen, and entered St John&rsquo;s College on the 29th
of June 1816. In 1820, as the eldest son of an earl&rsquo;s brother
with royal descent, he was enabled to take his M.A. degree
under the statutes of the university then in force. In the same
year he was appointed attaché to the British embassy at St
Petersburg, where he remained three years, and gained that
practical knowledge of diplomacy which was of so much use to
him in after-life. He had received from nature a singularly
handsome person, a polished and engaging address, a ready
command of languages, and a remarkable power of composition.</p>

<p>Upon his return to England in 1823 he was appointed to a
commissionership of customs, an office which he retained for
about ten years. In 1831 he was despatched to France to
negotiate a commercial treaty, which, however, led to no result.
On the 16th of August 1833 he was appointed minister at the
court of Spain. Ferdinand VII. died within a month of his
arrival at Madrid, and the infant queen Isabella, then in the
third year of her age, was placed by the old Spanish law of female
inheritance on her contested throne. Don Carlos, the late
king&rsquo;s brother, claimed the crown by virtue of the Salic law of
the House of Bourbon which Ferdinand had renounced before
the birth of his daughter. Isabella II. and her mother Christina,
the queen regent, became the representatives of constitutional
monarchy, Don Carlos of Catholic absolutism. The conflict
which had divided the despotic and the constitutional powers
of Europe since the French Revolution of 1830 broke out into
civil war in Spain, and by the Quadruple Treaty, signed on the
22nd of April 1834, France and England pledged themselves to
the defence of the constitutional thrones of Spain and Portugal.
For six years Villiers continued to give the most active and
intelligent support to the Liberal government of Spain. He
was accused, though unjustly, of having favoured the revolution
of La Granja, which drove Christina, the queen mother, out of
the kingdom, and raised Espartero to the regency. He
undoubtedly supported the chiefs of the Liberal party, such as
Espartero, against the intrigues of the French court; but the
object of the British government was to establish the throne
of Isabella on a truly national and liberal basis and to avert
those complications, dictated by foreign influence, which
eventually proved so fatal to that princess. Villiers received the
grand cross of the Bath in 1838 in acknowledgment of his services,
and succeeded, on the death of his uncle, to the title of earl of
Clarendon; in the following year, having left Madrid, he married
Katharine, eldest daughter of James Walter, first earl of Verulam.</p>

<p>In January 1840 he entered Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s administration
as lord privy seal, and from the death of Lord Holland in the
autumn of that year Lord Clarendon also held the office of
chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster until the dissolution of the
ministry in 1841. Deeply convinced that the maintenance of a
cordial understanding with France was the most essential
condition of peace and of a liberal policy in Europe, he reluctantly
concurred in the measures proposed by Lord Palmerston for
the expulsion of the pasha of Egypt from Syria; he strenuously
advocated, with Lord Holland, a more conciliatory policy
towards France; and he was only restrained from sending in
his resignation by the dislike he felt to break up a cabinet he
had so recently joined.</p>

<p>The interval of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s great administration (1841-1846)
was to the leaders of the Whig party a period of repose;
but Lord Clarendon took the warmest interest in the triumph
of the principles of free trade and in the repeal of the corn-laws,
of which his brother, Charles Pelham Villiers (<i>q.v.</i>), had been
one of the earliest champions. For this reason, upon the formation
of Lord John Russell&rsquo;s first administration, Lord Clarendon
accepted the office of president of the Board of Trade. Twice
in his career the governor-generalship of India was offered him,
and once the governor-generalship of Canada;&mdash;these he refused
from reluctance to withdraw from the politics of Europe. But
in 1847 a sense of duty compelled him to take a far more laborious
and uncongenial appointment. The desire of the cabinet was
to abolish the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland, and Lord Clarendon
was prevailed upon to accept that office, with a view to transform
it ere long into an Irish secretaryship of state. But he had not
been many months in Dublin before he acknowledged that the
difficulties then existing in Ireland could only be met by the
most vigilant and energetic authority, exercised on the spot.
The crisis was one of extraordinary peril. Agrarian crimes of
horrible atrocity had increased threefold. The Catholic clergy
were openly disaffected. This was the second year of the Irish
famine, and extraordinary measures were required to regulate
the bounty of the government and the nation. In 1848 the
revolution in France let loose fresh elements of discord, which
culminated in an abortive insurrection, and for a lengthened
period Ireland was a prey to more than her wonted symptoms
of disaffection and disorder. Lord Clarendon remained viceroy
of Ireland till 1852, and left behind him permanent marks of
improvement. His services were expressly acknowledged in the
queen&rsquo;s speech to both Houses of Parliament on the 5th of
September 1848&mdash;this being the first time that any <i>civil</i> services
obtained that honour; and he was made a knight of the Garter
(retaining also the grand cross of the Bath by special order) on
the 23rd of March 1849.</p>

<p>Upon the formation of the coalition ministry between the
Whigs and the Peelites, in 1853, under Lord Aberdeen, Lord
Clarendon became foreign minister. The country was already
&ldquo;drifting&rdquo; into the Crimean War, an expression of his own
which was never forgotten. Clarendon was not responsible for
the policy which brought war about; but when it occurred he
employed every means in his power to stimulate and assist the
war departments, and above all he maintained the closest
relations with the French. The tsar Nicholas had speculated
on the impossibility of the sustained joint action of France and
England in council and in the field. It was mainly by Lord
Clarendon at Whitehall and by Lord Raglan before Sevastopol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
that such a combination was rendered practicable, and did
eventually triumph over the enemy. The diplomatic conduct
of such an alliance for three years between two great nations
jealous of their military honour and fighting for no separate
political advantage, tried by excessive hardships and at moments
on the verge of defeat, was certainly one of the most arduous
duties ever performed by a minister. The result was due in the
main to the confidence with which Lord Clarendon had inspired
the emperor of the French, and to the affection and regard of
the empress, whom he had known in Spain from her childhood.</p>

<p>In 1856 Lord Clarendon took his seat at the congress of Paris
convoked for the restoration of peace, as first British
plenipotentiary. It was the first time since the appearance of Lord
Castlereagh at Vienna that a secretary of state for foreign
affairs had been present in person at a congress on the continent.
Lord Clarendon&rsquo;s first care was to obtain the admission of
Italy to the council chamber as a belligerent power, and to
raise the barrier which still excluded Prussia as a neutral one.
But in the general anxiety of all the powers to terminate the war
there was no small danger that the objects for which it had
been undertaken would be abandoned or forgotten. It is due
entirely to the firmness of Lord Clarendon that the principle
of the neutralization of the Black Sea was preserved, that the
Russian attempt to trick the allies out of the cession in Bessarabia
was defeated, and that the results of the war were for a time
secured. The congress was eager to turn to other subjects,
and perhaps the most important result of its deliberations was
the celebrated Declaration of the Maritime Powers, which
abolished privateering, defined the right of blockade, and
limited the right of capture to enemy&rsquo;s property in enemy&rsquo;s
ships. Lord Clarendon has been accused of an abandonment
of what are termed the belligerent rights of Great Britain, which
were undoubtedly based on the old maritime laws of Europe.
But he acted in strict conformity with the views of the British
cabinet, and the British cabinet adopted those views because it
was satisfied that it was not for the benefit of the country to
adhere to practices which exposed the vast mercantile interests
of Britain to depredation, even by the cruisers of a secondary
maritime power, and which, if vigorously enforced against
neutrals, could not fail to embroil her with every maritime
state in the world.</p>

<p>Upon the reconstitution of the Whig administration in 1859,
Lord John Russell made it a condition of his acceptance of office
under Lord Palmerston that the foreign department should be
placed in his own hands, which implied that Lord Clarendon
should be excluded from office, as it would have been inconsistent
alike with his dignity and his tastes to fill any other post in the
government. The consequence was that from 1859 till 1864
Lord Clarendon remained out of office, and the critical relations
arising out of the Civil War in the United States were left to the
guidance of Earl Russell. But he re-entered the cabinet in May
1864 as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; and upon the
death of Lord Palmerston in 1865, Lord Russell again became
prime minister, when Lord Clarendon returned to the foreign
office, which was again confided to him for the third time upon
the formation of Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s administration in 1868. To
the last moment of his existence, Lord Clarendon continued to
devote every faculty of his mind and every instant of his life
to the public service; and he expired surrounded by the boxes
and papers of his office on the 27th of June 1870. No man owed
more to the influence of a generous, unselfish and liberal disposition.
If he had rivals he never ceased to treat them with the
consideration and confidence of friends, and he cared but little
for the ordinary prizes of ambition in comparison with the
advancement of the cause of peace and progress.</p>

<p>He was succeeded as 5th earl by his eldest son, <span class="sc">Edward Hyde
Villiers</span> (b. 1846), who became lord chamberlain in 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARENDON, HENRY HYDE<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span>, <span class="sc">2nd Earl of</span> (1638-1709),
English statesman, eldest son of the first earl, was born on the
2nd of June 1638. He accompanied his parents into exile and
assisted his father as secretary, returning with them in 1660.
In 1661 he was returned to parliament for Wiltshire as Lord
Cornbury. He became secretary in 1662 and lord chamberlain
to the queen in 1665. He took no part in the life of the court,
and on the dismissal of his father became a vehement opponent
of the administration, defended his father in the impeachment,
and subsequently made effective attacks upon Buckingham
and Arlington. In 1674 he became earl of Clarendon by his
father&rsquo;s death, and in 1679 was made a privy councillor. He
was not included in Sir W. Temple&rsquo;s council of that year, but
was reappointed in 1680. In 1682 he supported Halifax&rsquo;s
proposal of declaring war on France. On the accession of James
in 1685 he was appointed lord privy seal, but shortly afterwards,
in September, was removed from this office to that of lord-lieutenant
of Ireland. Clarendon was embarrassed in his
estate, and James required a willing agent to carry out his
design by upsetting the Protestant government and the Act of
Settlement. Clarendon arrived in Dublin on the 9th of January
1686. He found himself completely in the power of Tyrconnel,
the commander-in-chief; and though, like his father, a staunch
Protestant, elected this year high steward of Oxford University,
and detesting the king&rsquo;s policy, he obeyed his orders to introduce
Roman Catholics into the government and the army and upon the
bench, and clung to office till after the dismissal of his brother,
the earl of Rochester, in January 1687, when he was recalled
and succeeded by Tyrconnel. He now supported the church
in its struggle with James, opposed the Declaration of Indulgence,
wrote to Mary an account of the resistance of the bishops,<a name="FnAnchor_1j" id="FnAnchor_1j" href="#Footnote_1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and
visited and advised the latter in the Tower. He had no share,
however, in inviting William to England. He assured James
in September that the Church would be loyal, advised the
calling of the parliament, and on the desertion of his son, Lord
Cornbury, to William on the 14th of November, expressed to
the king and queen the most poignant grief. In the council
held on the 27th, however, he made a violent and unseasonable
attack upon James&rsquo;s conduct, and on the 1st of December set
out to meet William, joined him on the 3rd at Berwick near
Salisbury, and was present at the conference at Hungerford
on the 8th, and again at Windsor on the 16th. His wish was
apparently to effect some compromise, saving the crown for
James. According to Burnet, he advised sending James to
Breda, and according to the duchess of Marlborough to the
Tower, but he himself denies these statements.<a name="FnAnchor_2j" id="FnAnchor_2j" href="#Footnote_2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> He opposed
vehemently the settlement of the crown upon William and Mary,
voted for the regency, and refused to take the oaths of the new
sovereigns, remaining a non-juror for the rest of his life. He
subsequently retired to the country, engaged in cabals against
the government, associated himself with Richard Graham, Lord
Preston, and organizing a plot against William, was arrested on
the 24th of June 1690 by order of his niece, Queen Mary, and
placed in the Tower. Liberated on the 15th of August, he immediately
recommenced his intrigues. On Preston&rsquo;s arrest on
the 31st of December, a compromising letter from Clarendon
was found upon him, and he was named by Preston as one of his
accomplices. He was examined before the privy council and
again imprisoned in the Tower on the 4th of January 1691,
remaining in confinement till the 3rd of July. This closed his
public career. In 1702, on Queen Anne&rsquo;s accession, he presented
himself at court, &ldquo;to talk to his niece,&rdquo; but the queen refused to
see him till he had taken the oaths. He died on the 31st of
October 1709, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>His public career had been neither distinguished nor useful, but
it seems natural to ascribe its failure to small abilities and to the
conflict between personal ties and political convictions which
drew him in opposite directions, rather than, following Macaulay,
to motives of self-interest. He was a man of some literary taste,
a fellow of the Royal Society (1684), the author of <i>The History and
Antiquities of the Cathedral Church of Winchester ... continued
by S. Gale</i> (1715), and he collaborated with his brother Rochester
in the publication of his father&rsquo;s <i>History</i> (1702-1704). He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
married (1) in 1660, Theodosia, daughter of Lord Capel, and (2)
in 1670, Flower, daughter of William Backhouse of Swallowfield
in Berkshire, and widow of William Bishopp and of Sir William
Backhouse, Bart. He was succeeded by his only son, Edward
(1661-1724), as 3rd earl of Clarendon; and, the latter having no
surviving son, the title passed to Henry, 2nd earl of Rochester
(1672-1753), at whose death without male heirs it became extinct
in the Hyde line.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARENDON, CONSTITUTIONS OF<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span>, a body of English laws
issued at Clarendon in 1164, by which Henry II. endeavoured to
settle the relations between Church and State. Though they
purported to declare the usages on the subject which prevailed in
the reign of Henry I. they were never accepted by the clergy, and
were formally renounced by the king at Avranches in September
1172. Some of them, however, were in part at least, as they all
purported to be, declaratory of ancient usage and remained in
force after the royal renunciation. Of the sixteen provisions the
one which provoked the greatest opposition was that which
declared in effect that criminous clerks were to be summoned to
the king&rsquo;s court, and from there, after formal accusation and
defence, sent to the proper ecclesiastical court for trial. If found
guilty they were to be degraded and sent back to the king&rsquo;s court
for punishment. Another provision, which in spite of all opposition
obtained a permanent place in English law, declared that all
suits even between clerk and clerk concerning advowsons and
presentations should be tried in the king&rsquo;s court. By other
provisions appeals to Rome without the licence of the king were
forbidden. None of the clergy were to leave the realm, nor were
the king&rsquo;s tenants-in-chief and ministers to be excommunicated or
their lands interdicted without the royal permission. Pleas of
debt, whether involving a question of good faith or not, were to
be in the jurisdiction of the king&rsquo;s courts. Two most interesting
provisions, to which the clergy offered no opposition, were: (1) if
a dispute arose between a clerk and a layman concerning a
tenement which the clerk claimed as free-alms (frankalmoign)
and the layman as a lay-fee, it should be determined by the
recognition of twelve lawful men before the king&rsquo;s justice whether
it belonged to free-alms or lay-fee, and if it were found to belong
to free-alms then the plea was to be held in the ecclesiastical
court, but if to lay-fee, in the court of the king or of one of his
magnates; (2) a declaration of the procedure for election to
bishoprics and royal abbeys, generally considered to state the
terms of the settlement made between Henry I. and Anselm in
1107.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARES, POOR<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span>, otherwise <i>Clarisses</i>, Franciscan nuns, so
called from their foundress, St Clara (<i>q.v.</i>). She was professed by
St Francis in the Portiuncula in 1212, and two years later she
and her first companions were established in the convent of St
Damian&rsquo;s at Assisi. The nuns formed the &ldquo;Second Order of St
Francis,&rdquo; the friars being the &ldquo;First Order,&rdquo; and the Tertiaries
(<i>q.v.</i>) the &ldquo;Third.&rdquo; Before Clara&rsquo;s death in 1253, the Second
Order had spread all over Italy and into Spain, France and
Germany; in England they were introduced c. 1293 and established
in London, outside Aldgate, where their name of Minoresses
survives in the Minories; there were only two other English
houses before the Dissolution. St Francis gave the nuns no rule,
but only a &ldquo;Form of Life&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Last Will,&rdquo; each only five
lines long, and coming to no more than an inculcation of his idea
of evangelical poverty. Something more than this became
necessary as soon as the institute began to spread; and during
Francis&rsquo;s absence in the East, 1219, his supporter Cardinal
Hugolino composed a rule which made the Franciscan nuns
practically a species of unduly strict Benedictines, St Francis&rsquo;s
special characteristics being eliminated. St Clara made it her
life work to have this rule altered, and to get the Franciscan
character of the Second Order restored; in 1247 a &ldquo;Second
Rule&rdquo; was approved which went a long way towards satisfying
her desires, and finally in 1253 a &ldquo;Third,&rdquo; which practically gave
what she wanted. This rule has come to be known as the &ldquo;Rule
of the Clares&rdquo;; it is one of great poverty, seclusion and austerity
of life. Most of the convents adopted it, but several clung to
that of 1247. To bring about conformity, St Bonaventura, while
general (1264), obtained papal permission to modify the rule of
1253, somewhat mitigating its austerities and allowing the
convents to have fixed incomes,&mdash;thus assimilating them to the
Conventual Franciscans as opposed to the Spirituals. This rule
was adopted in many convents, but many more adhered to the
strict rule of 1253. Indeed a counter-tendency towards a greater
strictness set in, and a number of reforms were initiated, introducing
an appalling austerity of life. The most important of
these reforms were the Coletines (St Colette, c. 1400) and the
Capucines (c. 1540; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Capuchins</a></span>). The half-dozen forms of
the Franciscan rule for women here mentioned are still in use in
different convents, and there are also a great number of religious
institutes for women based on the rule of the Tertiaries. By the
term &ldquo;Poor Clares&rdquo; the Coletine nuns are now commonly
understood; there are various convents of these nuns, as of other
Franciscans, in England and Ireland. Franciscan nuns have
always been very numerous; there are now about 150 convents of
the various observances of the Second Order, in every part of the
world, besides innumerable institutions of Tertiaries.</p>

chapel-master at Pistoia, was born at Pisa about the year
1669. The time of his death is unknown. He was the most
celebrated pupil of Colonna, chapel-master of S. Petronio, at
Bologna. He became <i>maestro di cappella</i> at Pistoia about 1712, at
Bologna in 1720, and at Pisa in 1736. He is supposed to have
died about 1745. The works by which Clari distinguished
himself pre-eminently are his vocal duets and trios, with a <i>basso
continuo</i>, published between 1740 and 1747. These compositions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>
which combine graceful melody with contrapuntal learning, were
much admired by Cherubini. They appear to have been admired
by Handel also, since he did not hesitate to make appropriations
from them. Clari composed one opera, <i>Il Savio delirante</i>,
produced at Bologna in 1695, and a large quantity of church
music, several specimens of which were printed in Novello&rsquo;s
<i>Fitzwilliam Music</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARINA<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span>, a comparatively new instrument of the wood-wind
class (although actually made of metal), a hybrid possessing
characteristics of both oboe and clarinet. The clarina was
invented by W. Heckel of Biebrich-am-Rhein, and has been used
since 1891 at the Festspielhaus, Bayreuth, in <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>,
as a substitute for the <i>Holztrompete</i> made according to Wagner&rsquo;s
instructions. The clarina has been found more practical and more
effective in producing the desired tone-colour. The clarina is a
metal instrument with the conical bore and fingering of the oboe
and the clarinet single-reed mouthpiece. The compass of the
instrument is as shown, and it stands in the key of B&#9837;. Like the
clarinet, the clarina is a transposing instrument, for which the
music must be written in a key a tone higher than that of the
composition. The timbre resulting from the combination of
conical bore and single-reed mouthpiece has in the lowest
register affinities with the <i>cor anglais</i>, in the middle with the
saxophone, and in the highest with the clarinet. Other
German orchestras have followed the example of Bayreuth.
The clarina has also been found very effective as a solo
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARINET<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Clarionet</span> (Fr. <i>clarinette</i>; Ger. <i>Clarinette,
Klarinett</i>; Ital. <i>clarinetto, chiarinetto</i>), a wood-wind instrument
having a cylindrical bore and played by means of a single-reed
mouthpiece. The word &ldquo;clarinet&rdquo; is said to be derived from
<i>clarinetto</i>, a diminutive of <i>clarino</i>, the Italian for (1) the soprano
trumpet, (2) the highest register of the instrument, (3) the
trumpet played musically without the blare of the martial
instrument. The word &ldquo;clarionet&rdquo; is similarly derived from
&ldquo;clarion,&rdquo; the English equivalent of <i>clarino</i>. It is suggested that
the name <i>clarinet</i> or <i>clarinetto</i> was bestowed on account of the
resemblance in timbre between the high registers of the clarino
and clarinet. By adding the speaker-hole to the old chalumeau,
J.C. Denner gave it an additional compass based on the overblowing
of the harmonic twelfth, and consisting of an octave and
a half of harmonics, which received the name of <i>clarino</i>, while
the lower register retained the name of <i>chalumeau</i>. There is
something to be said also in favour of another suggested derivation
from the Italian <i>chiarina</i>, the name for reed instruments and
the equivalent for tibia and aulos. At the beginning of the 18th
century in Italy <i>clarinetto</i>, the diminutive of <i>clarino</i>, would be
masculine, whereas <i>chiarinetta</i> or <i>clarinetta</i> would be feminine,<a name="FnAnchor_1k" id="FnAnchor_1k" href="#Footnote_1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> as
in Doppelmayr&rsquo;s account of the invention written in 1730. The
word &ldquo;clarinet&rdquo; is sometimes used in a generic sense to denote
the whole family, which consists of the clarinet, or discant
corresponding to the violin, oboe, &amp;c; the alto clarinet in E;
the basset horn in F (<i>q.v.</i>); the bass clarinet (<i>q.v.</i>), and the
pedal clarinet (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The modern clarinet consists of five (or four) separate pieces:
(1) the mouthpiece; (2) the bulb; (3) the upper middle joint, or
left-hand joint; (4) the lower middle joint, or right-hand joint<a name="FnAnchor_2k" id="FnAnchor_2k" href="#Footnote_2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a>;
(5) the bell; which (the bell excepted) when joined together, form
a tube with a continuous cylindrical bore, 2 ft. or more in length,
according to the pitch of the instrument. The mouthpiece,
including the beating or single-reed common to the whole
clarinet family, has the appearance of a beak with the point
bevelled off and thinned at the edge to correspond with the end of
the reed shaped like a spatula. The under part of the mouthpiece
(fig. 2) is flattened in order to form a table for the support of the
reed which is adjusted thereon with great nicety, allowing just
the amount of play requisite to set in vibration
the column of air within the tube.</p>

made of a material having great powers of
resistance, such as cocus wood, ivory or
vulcanite, which are mostly used for the
purpose in England. A longitudinal aperture
1 in. long and ½ in. wide, communicating with
the bore, is cut in the table and covered by
the reed. The aperture is thus closed except
towards the point, where, for the distance of
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> to ¼ in., the reed is thinned and the table
curves backwards towards the point, leaving
a gap between the ends of the mouthpiece and
of the reed of 1 mm. or about the thickness of
a sixpence for the B flat clarinet. The curve
of the table and the size of the gap are therefore
of considerable importance. The reed is
cut from a joint of the <i>Arundo donax</i> or <i>sativa</i>,
which grows wild in the regions bordering on
the Mediterranean. A flat slip of the reed is
cut, flattened on one side and thinned to a
very delicate edge on the other. At first the
reed was fastened to the table by means of
many turns of a fine waxed cord. The metal
band adjusted by means of two screws, known
as the &ldquo;ligature,&rdquo; was introduced about 1817
by Ivan Müller. The reed is set in vibration
by the breath of the performer, and being
flexible it beats against the table, opening
and closing the gap at a rate depending on
the rate of the vibrations it sets up in the
air column, this rate varying according to the
length of the column as determined by opening
the lateral holes and keys. A cylindrical tube
played by means of a reed has the acoustic
properties of a stopped pipe, <i>i.e.</i> the fundamental
tone produced by the tube is an
octave lower than the corresponding tone of
an open pipe of the same length, and overblows
a twelfth; whereas tubes having a conical bore like the
oboe, and played by means of a reed, speak as open pipes and
overblow an octave. This forms the fundamental difference
between the instruments of the oboe and
clarinet families. Wind instruments depending
upon lateral holes for the production
of their scale must either have as
many holes pierced in the bore as they
require notes, or make use of the property
possessed by the air-column of dividing
into harmonics or partials of the fundamental
tones. Twenty to twenty-two
holes is the number generally accepted as
the practical limit for the clarinet; beyond
that number the fingering and mechanism
become too complicated. The compass of
the clarinet is therefore extended through
the medium of the harmonic overtones.
In stopped pipes a node is formed near
the mouthpiece, and they are therefore only
able to produce the uneven harmonics, such
as the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, &amp;c, corresponding
to the fundamental, and the diatonic intervals of the 5th
one octave above, and of the 3rd and 7th two octaves above the
fundamental. By pressing the reed with the lip near the base
where it is thicker and stiffer, and increasing the pressure of the
breath, the air-column is forced to divide and to sound the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
harmonics, a principle well understood by the ancient Greeks
and Romans in playing upon the aulos and tibia.<a name="FnAnchor_3k" id="FnAnchor_3k" href="#Footnote_3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> This is
easier to accomplish with the double reed than with the beating
reed; in fact with a tube of wide diameter, such as that of the
modern clarinet, it would not be possible by this means alone
to do justice to the tone of the instrument or to the music now
written for it. The bore of the aulos was very much narrower
than that of the clarinet.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the production of the harmonic notes
on the clarinet, a small hole, closed by means of a key and called
the &ldquo;speaker,&rdquo; is bored near the mouthpiece. By means of
this small hole the air-column is placed in communication with
the external atmosphere, a ventral segment is formed, and the
air-column divides into three equal parts, producing a triple
number of vibrations resulting in the third note of the harmonic
series, at an interval of a twelfth above the fundamental.<a name="FnAnchor_4k" id="FnAnchor_4k" href="#Footnote_4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a> In a
wind instrument with lateral holes the fundamental note corresponding
to any particular hole is produced when all the holes
below that hole are open and it itself and all above it are closed,
the effective length of the resonating tube being shortened as
each of the closed holes is successively uncovered. In order to
obtain a complete chromatic scale on the clarinet at least eighteen
holes are required. This series produces with the bell-note a
succession of nineteen semitones, giving the range of a twelfth
and known as the fundamental scale or <i>chalumeau</i> register, so
called, no doubt, because it was the compass (without chromatic
semitones) of the more primitive predecessor of the clarinet,
known as the <i>chalumeau</i>, which must not be confounded with
the shawm or schalmey of the middle ages.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p style="clear: both;">The fundamental scale of the modern clarinet in C extends from
<img style="border:0; width:137px; height:60px" src="images/img438a.jpg" alt="" /> The next octave and a half is obtained by opening
the speaker key, whereby each of the fundamental notes is reproduced
a twelfth higher; the bell-note thus jumps from E to B&#9838;,
the first key gives instead of F its twelfth C&#9839;, and so on, extending
the compass to <img style="border:0; width:70px; height:60px" src="images/img438b.jpg" alt="" />, which ends the natural compass of the
instrument, although a skilful performer may obtain another octave
by cross-fingering. The names of the holes and keys on the
clarinet are derived not from the notes of the fundamental
scale, but from the name of the twelfth produced by overblowing
with the speaker key open; for instance, the first key near
the bell is known not as the E key but as the B&#9838;. The use of
the speaker key forms the greatest technical difficulty in learning
to play the clarinet, on account of the thumb having to do double
duty, closing one hole and raising the lever of the speaker key
simultaneously. In a clarinet designed by Richard Carte this
difficulty was ingeniously overcome by placing the left thumb-hole
towards the front, and closing it by a thumb-lever or with a ring
action by the first or second finger of the left hand, thus leaving the
thumb free to work the speaker key alone.</p>

<p>There is good reason to think that the ancient Greeks understood
the advantage of a speaker-hole, which they called <i>Syrinx</i>, for
facilitating the production of harmonics on the aulos. The credit
of the discovery of this interesting fact is due to A.A. Howard,<a name="FnAnchor_5k" id="FnAnchor_5k" href="#Footnote_5k"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
of Harvard University; it explains many passages in the classics
which before were obscure (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aulos</a></span>). Plutarch relates<a name="FnAnchor_6k" id="FnAnchor_6k" href="#Footnote_6k"><span class="sp">6</span></a> that
Telephanes of Megara was so incensed with the syrinx that he never
allowed his instrument-makers to place one on any of his auloi; he
even went so far as to absent himself, principally on account of the
syrinx, from the Pythian games. Telephanes was a great virtuoso
who scorned the use of a speaker-hole, being able to obtain his harmonics
on the aulos by the mere control of lips and teeth.</p>

<p>The modern clarinet has from thirteen to nineteen keys, some being
normally open and others closed. In order to understand why,
when once the idea of adding keys to the chalumeau had been
conceived, the number rose so slowly, keys being added one or two
at a time by makers of various nationalities at long intervals, it is
necessary to consider the effect of boring holes in the side of a
cylindrical tube. If it were possible to proceed from an absolute
theoretical basis, there would be but little difficulty; there are, however,
practical reasons which make this a matter of great difficulty.
According to V. Mahillon,<a name="FnAnchor_7k" id="FnAnchor_7k" href="#Footnote_7k"><span class="sp">7</span></a> the theoretical length of a B&#9837; clarinet
(French pitch diapason normal A = 435 vibrations), is 39 cm. when
the internal diameter of the bore measures exactly 1.4 cm. Any
increase in the diameter of the cylindrical bore for a given length
of tube raises the pitch proportionally and in the same way a decrease
lowers it. A bore narrow in proportion to the length facilitates the
production of the harmonics, which is no doubt the reason why the
aulos was made with a very narrow diameter, and produced such
deep notes in proportion to its length. In determining the position
of the holes along the tube, the thickness of the wood to be pierced
must be taken into consideration, for the length of the passage from
the main bore to the outer air adds to the length of the resonating
column; as, however, the clarinet tube is reckoned as a closed one,
only half the extra length must be taken into account. When placed
in its correct theoretical position, a hole should have its diameter
equal to the diameter of the main bore, which is the ideal condition
for obtaining a full, rich tone; it is, however, feasible to give the
hole a smaller diameter, altering its position by placing it nearer
the mouthpiece. These laws, which were likewise known to the
Greeks and Romans,<a name="FnAnchor_8k" id="FnAnchor_8k" href="#Footnote_8k"><span class="sp">8</span></a> had to be rediscovered by experience in the
18th and 19th centuries, during which the mechanism of the key
system was repeatedly improved. Due consideration having been
given to these points, it will also be necessary to remember that
the stopping of the seven open holes leaves only the two little fingers
(the thumb of the right hand being in the ordinary clarinet engaged
in supporting the instrument) free at all times for key service,
the other fingers doing duty when momentarily disengaged. The
fingering of the clarinet is the most difficult of any instrument in
the orchestra, for it differs in all four octaves of its compass. Once
mastered, however, it is the same for all clarinets, the music being
always written in the key of C.</p>

<p>The actual tonality of the clarinet is determined by the diatonic
scale produced when, starting with keys untouched and finger and
thumb-holes closed, the fingers are raised one by one from the holes.
In the B flat clarinet, the <i>real sounds</i> thus produced are</p>

<p class="noind">being part of the scale of B flat major. By the closing of two <i>open</i>
keys, the lower E flat and D are added.</p>

<p>The following are the various sizes of clarinets with the key proper

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;Although the single beating-reed associated with
the instruments of the clarinet family has been traced in ancient
Egypt, the double reed, characteristic of the oboe family, being
of simpler construction, was probably of still greater antiquity.
An ancient Egyptian pipe found in a mummy-case and now
preserved in the museum at Turin was found to contain a beating-reed
sunk 3 in. below the end of the pipe, which is the principle
of the drone. It would appear that the double chalumeau,
called arghoul (<i>q.v.</i>) by the modern Egyptians, was known in
ancient Egypt, although it was not perhaps in common use.
The Musée Guimet possesses a copy of a fresco from the tombs at
Saqqarah (executed under the direction of Mariette Bey) assigned
to the 4th or 5th dynasty, on which is shown a concert
with dancing; the instruments used are two harps, the long
oblique flute &ldquo;nay,&rdquo; blown from the end without any mouthpiece
or embouchure, and an instrument identified as an arghoul<a name="FnAnchor_9k" id="FnAnchor_9k" href="#Footnote_9k"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>
from its resemblance to the modern instrument of the same
name. This is believed to be the only illustration of the ancient
double chalumeau yet found in Egypt, with the single exception
of a hieroglyph occurring also once only, <i>i.e.</i> the sign read <i>As-it</i>,
consisting of a cylindrical pipe with a beak mouthpiece bound
round with a cord tied in a bow. The bow is taken to indicate
the double parallel pipes bound together; the same sign without
the bow occurs frequently and is read <i>Ma-it</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_10k" id="FnAnchor_10k" href="#Footnote_10k"><span class="sp">10</span></a> and is considered
to be the generic name for reed wind instruments. The beating-reed
was probably introduced into classic Greece from Egypt or
Asia Minor. A few ancient Greek instruments are extant, five
of which are in the British Museum. They are as nearly cylindrical
as would be the natural growing reed itself. The probability
is that both single and double reeds were at times used with the
Greek aulos and the Roman tibia. V. Mahillon and A.A.
Howard of Harvard have both obtained facsimiles of actual
instruments, some found at Pompeii and now deposited in the
museum at Naples, and others in the British Museum. Experiments
made with these instruments, whose original mouthpieces
have perished, show that with pipes of such narrow diameter
the fundamental scale and pitch are the same whether sounded
by means of a single or of a double reed, but the modern combination
of single reed and cylindrical tube alone gives the full
pure tone quality. The subject is more fully discussed in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aulos</a></span>.<a name="FnAnchor_11k" id="FnAnchor_11k" href="#Footnote_11k"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The Roman tibia, if monuments can be trusted,
sometimes had a beak-shaped mouthpiece, as for instance that
attached to a pipe discovered at Pompeii, or that shown in a
scene on Trajan&rsquo;s column.<a name="FnAnchor_12k" id="FnAnchor_12k" href="#Footnote_12k"><span class="sp">12</span></a> It is probable that when, at the
decline of the Roman empire, instrumental music was placed
by the church under a ban&mdash;and the tibia more especially from
its association with every form of licence and moral depravity&mdash;this
instrument, sharing the common fate, survived chiefly among
itinerant musicians who carried it into western Europe, where
it was preserved from complete extinction. An instrument
of difficult technique requiring an advanced knowledge of
acoustics was not, however, likely to flourish or even to be
understood among nations whose culture was as yet in its
infancy.</p>

<p>The tide of culture from the Byzantine empire filtered through
to the south and west, leaving many traces; a fresh impetus
was received from the east through the Arabs; and later, as a
result of the Crusades, the prototype of the clarinet, together
with the practical knowledge necessary for making the instrument
and playing upon it, may have been re-introduced through
any one or all of these sources. However this may be, the
instrument was during the Carolingian period identified with
the tibia of the Romans until such time as the new western
civilization ceased to be content to go back to classical Rome for
its models, and began to express itself, at first naively and
awkwardly, as the 11th century dawned. The name then
changed to the derivatives of the Greek <i>kalamos</i>, assuming an
almost bewildering variety of forms, of which the commonest
are chalemie, chalumeau, schalmey, scalmeye, shawm, calemel,
kalemele.<a name="FnAnchor_13k" id="FnAnchor_13k" href="#Footnote_13k"><span class="sp">13</span></a> The derivation of the name seems to point to a
Byzantine rather than an Arab source for the revival of the
instruments which formed the prototype of both oboe and
clarinet, but it must not be forgotten that the instruments with
a conical bore&mdash;more especially those played by a reed&mdash;are
primarily of Asiatic origin. At the beginning of the 13th century
in France, where the instrument remained a special favourite
until it was displaced by the clarinet, the chalumeau is mentioned
in some of the early romances:&mdash;&ldquo;Tabars et chalemiaux et
estrumens sonner&rdquo; (<i>Aye d&rsquo;Avignon</i>, v. 4137); &ldquo;Grelles et
chelimiaus et buisines bruians&rdquo; (<i>Gui de Bourgogne</i>, v. 1374),
&amp;c. By the end of the 13th century, the German equivalent
<i>Schalmey</i> appears in the literature of that country,&mdash;&ldquo;Pusûnen
und Schalmeyen schal moht niemen da gehoeren wal&rdquo; (<i>Frauendienst</i>,
492, fol. 5, Ulrich von Lichtenstein). The schalmey or
shawm is frequently represented in miniatures from the 13th
century, but it must have been known long before, since it was
at that period in use as the chaunter of the bag-pipe (<i>q.v.</i>),
a fully-developed complex instrument which presupposes a
separate previous existence for its component parts.</p>

<p>We have no reason to suppose that any distinction was drawn
between the single and double reed instruments during the
early middle ages&mdash;if indeed the single reed was then known at
all&mdash;for the derivatives of <i>kalamos</i> were applied to a variety of
pipes. The first clear and unmistakable drawing yet found of
the single reed occurs in Mersenne&rsquo;s <i>Harmonie universelle</i> (p. 282),
where the primitive reed pipe is shown with the beating-reed
detached from the tube of the instrument itself, by making a
lateral slit and then splitting back a little tongue of reed towards
a knot. Mersenne calls this the simplest form of chalumeau or
wheat-stalk (<i>tuyau de blé</i>). It is evident that no significance
was then attached to the form of the vibrating reed, whether
single or double, for Mersenne and other writers of his time
call the chaunters of the musette and cornemuse chalumeaux
whether they are of cylindrical or of conical bore. The difference
in timbre produced by the two kinds of reeds was, however,
understood, for Mersenne states that a special kind of cornemuse
was used in concert with the <i>hautbois de Poitou</i> (an oboe whose
double reed was enclosed in an air chamber) and was distinguished
from the shepherd&rsquo;s cornemuse by having double reeds throughout,
whereas the drones of the latter instrument were furnished
with beating reeds. It is therefore evident that as late as 1636
(the date at which Mersenne wrote) in France the word &ldquo;chalumeau&rdquo;
was not applied to the instrument transformed some
sixty years later into the clarinet, nor was it applied exclusively
to any one kind of pipe except when acting as the chaunter of
the bagpipe, and that independently of any structural characteristics.
The chaunter was still called chalumeau in 1737.<a name="FnAnchor_14k" id="FnAnchor_14k" href="#Footnote_14k"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
Of the instrument which has been looked upon as the chalumeau,
there is but little trace in Germany or in France at the beginning
of the 17th century. A chalumeau with beak mouthpiece and
characteristic short cylindrical tube pierced with six holes
figures among the musical instruments used for the triumphal
procession of the emperor Maximilian I., commemorated by a
fine series of plates,<a name="FnAnchor_15k" id="FnAnchor_15k" href="#Footnote_15k"><span class="sp">15</span></a> engraved on wood by Hans Burgkmair,
the friend and colleague of A. Dürer. On the same plate (No.
79) are five schalmeys with double reeds and five chalumeaux
with single-reed beak mouthpieces; the latter instruments were
in all probability made in the Netherlands, which excelled from
the 12th century in the manufacture of all musical instruments.
No single-reed instrument, with the exception of the regal (<i>q.v.</i>),
is figured by S. Virdung,<a name="FnAnchor_16k" id="FnAnchor_16k" href="#Footnote_16k"><span class="sp">16</span></a> M.

<p>A good idea of the primitive chalumeau may be gained from a
reproduction of one of the few specimens from the 16th or 17th
century still extant, which belonged to Césare Snoeck and was

the reed, and a tongue has been detached just under the joint;
there are six finger-holes and one for the thumb. An instrument
almost identical with the above, but with a rudimentary bell,
and showing plainly the detached tongue, is
figured by Jost Amman in 1589.<a name="FnAnchor_20k" id="FnAnchor_20k" href="#Footnote_20k"><span class="sp">20</span></a> A plate in

it is very similar to the one represented in fig. 3,
except that only six holes are visible.</p>

<p>In his biographical notice of J. Christian
Denner (1655-1707), J.G. Doppelmayr<a name="FnAnchor_23k" id="FnAnchor_23k" href="#Footnote_23k"><span class="sp">23</span></a> states
that at the beginning of the 18th century
&ldquo;Denner invented a new kind of pipe, the so-called
clarinet, which greatly delighted lovers of
music; he also made great improvements in the
stock or rackett-fagottos, known in the olden
time and finally also in the chalumeaux.&rdquo; It
is probable that the improvements in the
chalumeau to which Doppelmayr alludes without
understanding them consisted (<i>a</i>) in giving
the mouthpiece the shape of a beak and adding
a separate reed tongue as in that of the modern
clarinet, unless this change had already taken
place in the Netherlands, the country which the
unremitting labours of E. van der Straeten<a name="FnAnchor_24k" id="FnAnchor_24k" href="#Footnote_24k"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
have revealed as taking the lead in Europe from
the 14th to the 16th century in the construction
of musical instruments of all kinds; (<i>b</i>) in
the boring of two additional holes for A and B
near the mouthpiece and covering them with
two keys; (<i>c</i>) in replacing the long cylindrical
mouthpiece joint by a bulb, thus restoring one
of the characteristic features of the tibia,<a name="FnAnchor_25k" id="FnAnchor_25k" href="#Footnote_25k"><span class="sp">25</span></a> known
as the <span class="grk" title="holmos">&#8005;&#955;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>. There are a few of these improved
chalumeaux in existence, two being in the
Bavarian national museum at Munich, the one in high A, in a bad
state of preservation, the second in C, marked J.C. Denner, of
which V. Mahillon has made a facsimile<a name="FnAnchor_26k" id="FnAnchor_26k" href="#Footnote_26k"><span class="sp">26</span></a> for the museum of the
Brussels Conservatoire. There are two keys and eight holes;
the first consists of two small holes on the same level giving a
semitone if only one be closed. If the thumb-key be left open,
the sounds of the fundamental scale (shown in the black notes
below) rise a twelfth to form the second register (the white notes).</p>

<p class="noind">This early clarinet or improved chalumeau has a clarinet mouthpiece,
but no bulb; it measures 50 cm. (20 in.), whereas the one in
A mentioned above is only 28 cm. in length, the long cylindrical
tube between mouthpiece and key-joint, afterwards turned into
the bulb, being absent. Mahillon was probably the first to point
out that the so-called invention of the clarinet by J.C. Denner
consisted in providing a device&mdash;the speaker-key&mdash;to facilitate
the production of the harmonics of the fundamental. Can we be
sure that the same result was not obtained on the old chalumeau
before keys were added, by partially uncovering the hole for the thumb?</p>

<p>The Berlin museum possesses an early clarinet with two keys,
marked J.B. Oberlender, derived from the Snoeck collection.
Paul de Wit&rsquo;s collection has a similar specimen by Enkelmer.
The Brussels Conservatoire possesses clarinets with two keys by
Flemish makers, G.A. Rottenburgh and J.B. Willems<a name="FnAnchor_27k" id="FnAnchor_27k" href="#Footnote_27k"><span class="sp">27</span></a>; the
latter, with a small bulb and bell, is in G a fifth above the C
clarinet. The next improvements in the clarinet, made in 1720,
are due to J. Denner, probably a son of J.C. Denner. They
consisted in the addition of a bell and in the removal of the
speaker-hole and key nearer the mouthpiece, involving the
reduction of the diameter of the hole. The effect of this change of
position was to turn the B&#9838; into B&#9837;, for J. Denner introduced into
the hole, nearly as far as the axis of the bore, a small metal
drainage tube<a name="FnAnchor_28k" id="FnAnchor_28k" href="#Footnote_28k"><span class="sp">28</span></a> for the moisture of the breath. In the modern
clarinet, the same result is attained by raising this little tube
slightly above the surface of the main tube, placing a key on the
top of it, and bending the lever. In order to produce the missing
B&#9838;, J. Denner lengthened the tube and pierced another hole, the
low E, covered by an open key with a long lever which, when
closed, gives the desired B as its twelfth, thus forming a connexion
between the two registers. A clarinet with three keys, of similar
construction (about 1750), marked J.W. Kenigsperger, is preserved
in the Bavarian national museum, at Munich. Another
in B&#9837; marked Lindner<a name="FnAnchor_29k" id="FnAnchor_29k" href="#Footnote_29k"><span class="sp">29</span></a> belongs to the collection at Brussels.
About the middle of the 18th century, the number of keys was
raised to five, some say<a name="FnAnchor_30k" id="FnAnchor_30k" href="#Footnote_30k"><span class="sp">30</span></a> by Barthold Fritz of Brunswick
(1697-1766), who added keys for C&#9839; and D&#9839;.

According to Altenburg<a name="FnAnchor_31k" id="FnAnchor_31k" href="#Footnote_31k"><span class="sp">31</span></a> the E&#9837; or D&#9839; key is due to the virtuoso
Joseph Beer (1744-1811). The sixth key was added about 1790
by the celebrated French virtuoso Xavier Lefébure (or Lefèvre),
and produced G&#9839;.

<img style="border:0; width:87px; height:63px" src="images/img440d.jpg" alt="" />

Anton Stadler and his brother,
both clarinettists in the Vienna court orchestra and instrument-makers,
are said to have lengthened the tube of the B&#9837; clarinet,
extending the compass down to C (real sound B&#9837;). It was for
the Stadler brothers that Mozart wrote his quintet for strings,
with a fine obbligato for the clarinet in A (1789), and the clarinet
concerto with orchestra in 1791.</p>

<p>This, then, was the state of the clarinet in 1810 when Ivan
Müller, then living in Paris, carried the number of keys up to
thirteen, and made several structural improvements already
mentioned, which gave us the modern instrument and inaugurated
a new era in the construction and technique of the
clarinet. Müller&rsquo;s system is still adopted in principle by most
clarinet makers. The instrument was successively improved
during the 19th century by the Belgian makers Bachmann, the
elder Sax, Albert and C. Mahillon, whose invention in 1862 of the
C&#9839; key with double action is now generally adopted. In Paris the
labours of Lefébure, Buffet-Crampon, and Goumas are pre-eminent.
In 1842 H.E. Klosé conceived the idea of adapting to
the clarinet the ingenious mechanism of movable rings, invented
by Boehm for the flute, and he entrusted the execution of this
innovation to Buffet-Crampon; this is the type of clarinet
generally adopted in French orchestras. From this adaptation
has sprung the erroneous notion that Klosé&rsquo;s clarinet was
constructed according to the Boehm system; Klosé&rsquo;s lateral
divisions of the tube do not follow those applied by Boehm to
the flute.</p>

<p>In England the clarinet has also passed through several
progressive stages since its introduction about 1770, and first of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>441</span>
all at the hands of Cornelius Ward. The principal improvements
were due to Richard Carte, who took out a patent in 1858 for an
improved Boehm clarinet which possessed some claim to the
name, since Boehm&rsquo;s principle of boring the holes at theoretically
correct intervals and of venting the holes
by means of open holes below was carried
out. Carte made several modifications of
his original patent, his chief endeavour
being to so dispose the key-work as to
reduce the difficulties in fingering. By the
extension of the principle of the ring
action, the work of the third and little
fingers of the left hand was simplified and
the fingering of certain difficult notes and
shakes greatly facilitated. Messrs Rudall,
Carte &amp; Company have made further
improvements in the clarinet, which are
embodied in Klussmann&rsquo;s patent (fig. 4);
these consist in the introduction of the
duplicate G&#9839; key, a note which has
hitherto formed a serious obstacle to
perfect execution. The duplicate key,
operated by the third or second finger of
the right hand, releases the fourth finger
of the left hand. The old G&#9839; is still retained
and may be used in the usual way
if desired. The body of the instrument
is now made in one joint, and the position
of the G&#9839; hole is mathematically correct,
whereby perfect intonation for C&#9839;, G&#9839; and
F&#9838; is secured. Other improvements were
made in Paris by Messrs Evette &amp; Schaeffer
and by M. Paradis,<a name="FnAnchor_32k" id="FnAnchor_32k" href="#Footnote_32k"><span class="sp">32</span></a> a clarinet-player in
the band of the Garde Républicaine, and
very great improvements in boring and in
key mechanism were effected by Albert
of Brussels (see fig. 1).</p>

<p>The clarinet appears to have received
appreciation in the Netherlands earlier
than in its own native land. According
to W. Altenburg (op. cit. p. 11),<a name="FnAnchor_33k" id="FnAnchor_33k" href="#Footnote_33k"><span class="sp">33</span></a> a MS. is
preserved in the cathedral at Antwerp of
a mass written by A.J. Faber in 1720,
which is scored for a clarinet. Johann
Mattheson,<a name="FnAnchor_34k" id="FnAnchor_34k" href="#Footnote_34k"><span class="sp">34</span></a> <i>Kapellmeister</i> at Hamburg,
mentions clarinet music in 1713, although
Handel, whose rival he was, does not appear to have known the
instrument. Joh. Christ. Bach scored for the clarinet in 1763 in
his opera <i>Orione</i> performed in London, and Rameau had already
employed the instrument in 1751 in a theatre for his pastoral
entitled <i>Acante et Céphise</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_35k" id="FnAnchor_35k" href="#Footnote_35k"><span class="sp">35</span></a> The clarinet was formally introduced
into the orchestra in Vienna in 1767,<a name="FnAnchor_36k" id="FnAnchor_36k" href="#Footnote_36k"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Gluck having contented
himself with the use of the chalumeau in <i>Orfeo</i> (1762) and in
<i>Alceste</i> (1767).<a name="FnAnchor_37k" id="FnAnchor_37k" href="#Footnote_37k"><span class="sp">37</span></a> The clarinet had already been adopted in
military bands in France in 1755, where it very speedily completely
replaced the oboe. One of Napoleon Bonaparte&rsquo;s bands
is said to have had no less than twenty clarinets.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARK, SIR ANDREW<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span>, Bart. (1826-1893), British physician,
was born at Aberdeen on the 28th of October 1826. His father,
who also was a medical man, died when he was only a few years
old. After attending school in Aberdeen, he was sent by his
guardians to Dundee and apprenticed to a druggist; then
returning to Aberdeen he began his medical studies in the university
of that city. Soon, however, he went to Edinburgh,
where in the extra-academical school he had a student&rsquo;s career of
the most brilliant description, ultimately becoming assistant to
J. Hughes Bennett in the pathological department of the Royal
Infirmary, and assistant demonstrator of anatomy to Robert
Knox. But symptoms of pulmonary phthisis brought his
academic life to a close, and in the hope that the sea might
benefit his health he joined the medical department of the navy in
1848. Next year he became pathologist to the Haslar hospital,
where T.H. Huxley was one of his colleagues, and in 1853 he was
the successful candidate for the newly-instituted post of curator
to the museum of the London hospital. Here he intended to
devote all his energies to pathology, but circumstances brought
him into active medical practice. In 1854, the year in which he
took his doctor&rsquo;s degree at Aberdeen, the post of assistant-physician
to the hospital became vacant and he was prevailed
upon to apply for it. He was fond of telling how his phthisical
tendencies gained him the appointment. &ldquo;He is only a poor
Scotch doctor,&rdquo; it was said, &ldquo;with but a few months to live; let
him have it.&rdquo; He had it, and two years before his death publicly
declared that of those who were on the staff of the hospital at the
time of his selection he was the only one remaining alive. In
1854 he became a member of the College of Physicians, and in
1858 a fellow, and then went in succession through all the offices
of honour the college has to offer, ending in 1888 with the
presidency, which he continued to hold till his death. From the
time of his selection as assistant physician to the London
hospital, his fame rapidly grew until he became a fashionable
doctor with one of the largest practices in London, counting
among his patients some of the most distinguished men of the
day. The great number of persons who passed through his
consulting-room every morning rendered it inevitable that to
a large extent his advice should become stereotyped and his
prescriptions often reduced to mere stock formulae, but in really
serious cases he was not to be surpassed in the skill and carefulness
of his diagnosis and in his attention to detail. In spite
of the claims of his practice he found time to produce a good
many books, all written in the precise and polished style on
which he used to pride himself. Doubtless owing largely to
personal reasons, lung diseases and especially fibroid phthisis
formed his favourite theme, but he also discussed other subjects,
such as renal inadequacy, anaemia, constipation, &amp;c. He died
in London on the 6th of November 1893, after a paralytic stroke
which was probably the result of persistent overwork.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARK, FRANCIS EDWARD<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1851-&emsp;&emsp;), American clergyman,
was born of New England ancestry at Aylmer, Province of
Quebec, Canada, on the 12th of September 1851. He was the son
of Charles C. Symmes, but took the name of an uncle, the Rev.
E.W. Clark, by whom he was adopted after his father&rsquo;s death in
1853. He graduated at Dartmouth College in 1873 and at
Andover Theological Seminary in 1876, was ordained in the
Congregational ministry, and was pastor of the Williston Congregational
church at Portland, Maine, from 1876 to 1883, and of
the Phillips Congregational church, South Boston, Mass., from
1883 to 1887. On the 2nd of February 1881 he founded at
Portland the Young People&rsquo;s Society of Christian Endeavor,
which, beginning as a small society in a single New England
church, developed into a great interdenominational organization,
which in 1908 had 70,761 societies and more than 3,500,000
members scattered throughout the United States, Canada, Great
Britain, Australia, South Africa, India, Japan and China.
After 1887 he devoted his time entirely to the extension of this
work, and was president of the United Societies of Christian
Endeavor and of the World&rsquo;s Christian Endeavor Union, and
editor of the <i>Christian Endeavor World</i> (originally <i>The Golden
Rule</i>). Among his numerous publications are <i>The Children and the
Church</i> (1882); <i>Looking Out on Life</i> (1883); <i>Young People&rsquo;s Prayer
Meetings</i> (1884); <i>Some Christian Endeavor Saints</i> (1889); <i>World-Wide

<p><span class="bold">CLARK, GEORGE ROGERS<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1752-1818), American frontier
military leader, was born near Charlottesville, in Albemarle
county, Virginia, on the 19th of November 1752. Early in life
he became a land-surveyor; he took part in Lord Dunmore&rsquo;s
War (1774), and in 1775 went as a surveyor for the Ohio Company
to Kentucky (then a district of Virginia), whither he removed
early in 1776. His iron will, strong passions, audacious courage
and magnificent physique soon made him a leader among his
frontier neighbours, by whom in 1776 he was sent as a delegate
to the Virginia legislature. In this capacity he was instrumental
in bringing about the organization of Kentucky as a county of
Virginia, and also obtained from Governor Patrick Henry a
supply of powder for the Kentucky settlers. Convinced that
the Indians were instigated and supported in their raids against
the American settlers by British officers stationed in the forts
north of the Ohio river, and that the conquest of those forts
would put an end to the evil, he went on foot to Virginia late
in 1777 and submitted to Governor Henry and his council a
plan for offensive operations. On the 2nd of January 1778 he
was commissioned lieutenant-colonel, received £1200 in depreciated
currency, and was authorized to enlist troops; and
by the end of May he was at the falls of the Ohio (the site of
Louisville) with about 175 men. The expedition proceeded
to Fort Kaskaskia, on the Mississippi, in what is now Illinois.
This place and Cahokia, also on the Mississippi, near St Louis,
were defended by small British garrisons, which depended upon
the support of the French <i>habitants</i>. The French being willing
to accept the authority of Virginia, both forts were easily taken.
Clark gained the friendship of Father Pierre Gibault, the priest
at Kaskaskia, and through his influence the French at Vincennes
on the Wabash were induced (late in July) to change their
allegiance. On the 17th of December Lieut.-Governor Henry
Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit, recovered Vincennes
and went into winter quarters. Late in February 1779 he was
surprised by Clark and compelled to give up Vincennes and its
fort, Fort Sackville, and to surrender himself and his garrison
of about 80 men, as prisoners of war. With the exception of
Detroit and several other posts on the Canadian frontier the
whole of the North-West was thus brought under American
influence; many of the Indians, previously hostile, became
friendly, and the United States was put in a position to demand
the cession of the North-West in the treaty of 1783. For this
valuable service, in which Clark had freely used his own private
funds, he received practically no recompense either from Virginia
or from the United States, and for many years before his death
he lived in poverty. To him and his men, however, the Virginia
legislature granted 150,000 acres of land in 1781, which was
subsequently located in what are now Clark, Floyd and Scott
counties, Indiana; Clark&rsquo;s individual share was 8049 acres, but
from this he realized little. Clark built Fort Jefferson on the
Mississippi, 4 or 5 m. below the mouth of the Ohio, in 1780,
destroyed the Indian towns Chillicothe and Piqua in the same
year, and in November 1782 destroyed the Indian towns on the
Miami river. With this last expedition his active military
service virtually ended, and in July 1783 he was relieved of his
command by Virginia. Thereafter he lived on part of the land
granted to him by Virginia or in Louisville for the rest of his
life. In 1793 he accepted from Citizen Genet a commission as
&ldquo;major-general in the armies of France, and commander-in-chief
of the French Revolutionary Legion in the Mississippi Valley,&rdquo;
and tried to raise a force for an attack upon the Spanish
possessions in the valley of the Mississippi. The scheme,
however, was abandoned after Genet&rsquo;s recall. Disappointed
at what he regarded as his country&rsquo;s ingratitude, and broken
down by excessive drinking and paralysis, he lost his once
powerful influence and lived in comparative isolation until his
death, near Louisville, Kentucky, on the 13th of February 1818.</p>

the youngest brother of the foregoing. He was born in Caroline
county, Virginia, on the 1st of August 1770. At the age of
fourteen he removed with his parents to Kentucky, settling
at the falls of the Ohio (Louisville). He entered the United
States army as a lieutenant of infantry in March 1792, and
served under General Anthony Wayne against the Indians in
1794. In July 1796 he resigned his commission on account of
ill-health. In 1803-1806, with Meriwether Lewis (<i>q.v.</i>), he
commanded the famous exploring expedition across the continent
to the mouth of the Columbia river, and was commissioned
second lieutenant in March 1804 and first lieutenant in January
1806. In February he again resigned from the army. He then
served for a few years as brigadier-general of the Louisiana
territorial militia, as Indian agent for &ldquo;Upper Louisiana,&rdquo; as
territorial governor of Missouri in 1813-1820, and as superintendent
of Indian affairs at St Louis from 1822 until his death

<p><span class="bold">CLARK, SIR JAMES<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1788-1870), English physician, was born
at Cullen, Banffshire, and was educated at the grammar school
of Fordyce and at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
He served for six years as a surgeon in the army; then spent
some time in travelling on the continent, in order to investigate
the mineral waters and the climate of various health resorts;
and for seven years he lived in Rome. In 1826 he began to
practise in London. In 1835 he was appointed physician to the

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARK, JOSIAH LATIMER<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (1822-1898), English engineer and
electrician, was born on the 10th of March 1822 at Great Marlow,
Bucks. His first interest was in chemical manufacturing, but in
1848 he became assistant engineer at the Menai Straits bridge
under his elder brother Edwin (1814-1894), the inventor of the
Clark hydraulic lift graving dock. Two years later, when his
brother was appointed engineer to the Electric Telegraph
Company, he again acted as his assistant, and subsequently
succeeded him as chief engineer. In 1854 he took out a patent
&ldquo;for conveying letters or parcels between places by the pressure
of air and vacuum,&rdquo; and later was concerned in the construction
of a large pneumatic despatch tube between the general post
office and Euston station, London. About the same period he
was engaged in experimental researches on the propagation of
the electric current in submarine cables, on which he published a
pamphlet in 1855, and in 1859 he was a member of the committee
which was appointed by the government to consider the
numerous failures of submarine cable enterprises. Latimer
Clark paid much attention to the subject of electrical measurement,
and besides designing various improvements in method and
apparatus and inventing the Clark standard cell, he took a
leading part in the movement for the systematization of electrical
standards, which was inaugurated by the paper which he and Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
C.T. Bright read on the question before the British Association in
1861. With Bright also he devised improvements in the insulation
of submarine cables. In the later part of his life he was a
member of several firms engaged in laying submarine cables, in
manufacturing electrical appliances, and in hydraulic engineering.
He died in London on the 30th of October 1898. Besides professional
papers, he published an <i>Elementary Treatise on Electrical
Measurement</i> (1868), together with two books on astronomical
subjects, and a memoir of Sir W.F. Cooke.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARK, THOMAS<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1801-1867), Scottish chemist, was born at
Ayr on the 31st of March 1801. In 1826 he was appointed
lecturer on chemistry at the Glasgow mechanics&rsquo; institute, and in
1831 he took the degree of M.D. at the university of that city.
Two years later he became professor of chemistry in Marischal
College, Aberdeen, but was obliged to give up the duties of that
position in 1844 through ill-health, though nominally he remained
professor till 1860. His name is chiefly known in connexion with
his process for softening hard waters, and his water tests,
patented in 1841. The last twenty years before his death at
Glasgow on the 27th of November 1867 were occupied with the
study of the historical origin of the Gospels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARK, WILLIAM GEORGE<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1821-1878), English classical
and Shakespearian scholar, was born at Barford Hall, Darlington,
in March 1821. He was educated at Sedbergh and Shrewsbury
schools and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected
fellow after a brilliant university career. In 1857 he was
appointed public orator. He travelled much during the long
vacations, visiting Spain, Greece, Italy and Poland. His
<i>Peloponnesus</i> (1858) was an important contribution to the
knowledge of the country at that time. In 1853 Clark had taken
orders, but left the Church in 1870 after the passing of the
Clerical Disabilities Act, of which he was one of the promoters.
He also resigned the public oratorship in the same year, and in
consequence of illness left Cambridge in 1873. He died at York
on the 6th of November 1878. He bequeathed a sum of money to
his old college for the foundation of a lectureship in English
literature. Although Clark was before all a classical scholar, he
published little in that branch of learning. A contemplated
edition of the works of Aristophanes, a task for which he was
singularly fitted, was never published. He visited Italy in 1868
for the express purpose of examining the Ravenna and other MSS.,
and on his return began the notes to the <i>Acharnians</i>, but they
were left in too incomplete a state to admit of publication in book
form even after his death (see <i>Journal of Philology</i>, viii., 1879).
He established the Cambridge <i>Journal of Philology</i>, and cooperated
with B.H. Kennedy and James Riddell in the production
of the well-known <i>Sabrinae Corolla</i>. The work by which
he is best known is the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863-1866),
containing a collation of early editions and selected emendations,
edited by him at first with John Glover and afterwards with
W. Aldis Wright. <i>Gazpacho</i> (1853)gives an account of his tour in
Spain; his visits to Italy at the time of Garibaldi&rsquo;s insurrection,
and to Poland during the insurrection of 1863, are described in
<i>Vacation Tourists</i>, ed. F. Galton, i. and iii.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, ADAM<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1762?-1832), British Nonconformist
divine, was born at Moybeg, Co. Londonderry, Ireland, in 1760
or 1762. After receiving a very limited education he was
apprenticed to a linen manufacturer, but, finding the employment
uncongenial, he resumed school-life at the institution
founded by Wesley at Kingswood, near Bristol. In 1782 he
entered on the duties of the ministry, being appointed by Wesley
to the Bradford (Wiltshire) circuit. His popularity as a preacher
was very great, and his influence in the denomination is indicated
by the fact that he was three times (1806, 1814, 1822) chosen to
be president of the conference. He served twice on the London
circuit, the second period being extended considerably longer
than the rule allowed, at the special request of the British and
Foreign Bible Society, who had employed him in the preparation
of their Arabic Bible. Though ardent in his pastoral work, he
found time for diligent study of Hebrew and other Oriental
languages, undertaken chiefly with the view of qualifying himself
for the great work of his life, his <i>Commentary on the Holy
Scriptures</i> (8 vols., 1810-1820). In 1802 he published a <i>Bibliographical
Dictionary</i> in six volumes, to which he afterwards
added a supplement. He was selected by the Records Commission
to re-edit Rymer&rsquo;s <i>Foedera</i>, a task which after ten years&rsquo;
labour (1808-1818) he had to resign. He also wrote <i>Memoirs of
the Wesley Family</i> (1823), and edited a large number of religious
works. Honours were showered upon him (he was M.A., LL.D.
of Aberdeen), and many distinguished men in church and state
were his personal friends. He died in London on the 16th of
August 1832.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>Miscellaneous Works</i> were published in 13 vols. (1836), and a
<i>Life</i> (3 vols.) by his son, J.B.B. Clarke, appeared in 1833.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, SIR ANDREW<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1824-1902), British soldier and
administrator, son of Colonel Andrew Clarke, of Co. Donegal,
Ireland, governor of West Australia, was born at Southsea,
England, on the 27th of July 1824, and educated at King&rsquo;s
school, Canterbury. He entered the Royal Military Academy,
Woolwich, and obtained his commission in the army in 1844
as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. He was appointed
to his father&rsquo;s staff in West Australia, but was transferred to be
A.D.C. and military secretary to the governor of Tasmania;
and in 1847 he went to New Zealand to take part in the Maori
War, and for some years served on Sir George Grey&rsquo;s staff.
He was then made surveyor-general in Victoria, took a prominent
part in framing its new constitution, and held the office of
minister of public lands during the first administration (1855-1857).
He returned to England in 1857, and in 1863 was sent
on a special mission to the West Coast of Africa. In 1864 he
was appointed director of works for the navy, and held this
post for nine years, being responsible for great improvements
in the naval arsenals at Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth,
and for fortifications at Malta, Cork, Bermuda and elsewhere.
In 1873 he was made K.C.M.G., and became governor of the
Straits Settlements, where he did most valuable work in consolidating
British rule and ameliorating the condition of the
people. From 1875 to 1880 he was minister of public works in
India; and on his return to England in 1881, holding then the
rank of lieutenant-colonel in the army, he was first appointed
commandant at Chatham and then inspector-general of fortifications
(1882-1886). Having attained the rank of lieutenant-general
and been created G.C.M.G., he retired from official life,
and in 1886 and 1893 unsuccessfully stood for parliament as a
supporter of Mr Gladstone. During his last years he was agent-general
for Victoria. He died on the 29th of March 1902. Both
as a technical and strategical engineer and as an Imperial
administrator Sir Andrew Clarke was one of the ablest and most
useful public servants of his time; and his contributions to
periodical literature, as well as his official memoranda, contained
valuable suggestions on the subjects of imperial defence and
imperial consolidation which received too little consideration
at a period when the home governments were not properly alive
to their importance. He is entitled to remembrance as one of
those who first inculcated, from a wide practical experience,
the views of imperial administration and its responsibilities,
which in his last years he saw accepted by the bulk of his countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, CHARLES COWDEN<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1787-1877), English author
and Shakespearian scholar, was born at Enfield, Middlesex,
on the 15th of December 1787. His father, John Clarke, was a
schoolmaster, among whose pupils was John Keats. Charles
Clarke taught Keats his letters, and encouraged his love of
poetry. He knew Charles and Mary Lamb, and afterwards
became acquainted with Shelley, Leigh Hunt, Coleridge and
Hazlitt. Clarke became a music publisher in partnership with
Alfred Novello, and married in 1828 his partner&rsquo;s sister, Mary
Victoria (1809-1898), the eldest daughter of Vincent Novello.
In the year after her marriage Mrs Cowden Clarke began her
valuable Shakespeare concordance, which was eventually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>444</span>
issued in eighteen monthly parts (1844-1845), and in volume
form in 1845 as <i>The Complete Concordance to Shakespeare, being
a Verbal Index to all the Passages in the Dramatic Works of the
Poet</i>. This work superseded the <i>Copious Index to ... Shakespeare</i>
(1790) of Samuel Ayscough, and the <i>Complete Verbal
Index ...</i> (1805-1807) of Francis Twiss. Charles Cowden
Clarke published many useful books, and edited the text for
John Nichol&rsquo;s edition of the British poets; but his most important
work consisted of lectures delivered between 1834 and 1856
on Shakespeare and other literary subjects. Some of the more
notable series were published, among them being <i>Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Characters, chiefly those subordinate</i> (1863), and <i>Molière&rsquo;s Characters</i>
(1865). In 1859 he published a volume of original poems,
<i>Carmina Minima</i>. For some years after their marriage the
Cowden Clarkes lived with the Novellos in London. In 1849
Vincent Novello with his wife removed to Nice, where he was
joined by the Clarkes in 1856. After his death they lived at
Genoa at the &ldquo;Villa Novello.&rdquo; They collaborated in <i>The
Shakespeare Key, unlocking the Treasures of his Style ...</i> (1879),
and in an edition of Shakespeare for Messrs Cassell, which was
issued in weekly parts, and completed in 1868. It was reissued
in 1886 as <i>Cassell&rsquo;s Illustrated Shakespeare</i>. Charles Clarke died
on the 13th of March 1877 at Genoa, and his wife survived him
until the 12th of January 1898. Among Mrs Cowden Clarke&rsquo;s
other works may be mentioned <i>The Girlhood of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Heroines</i> (3 vols., 1850-1852), and a translation of Berlioz&rsquo;s
<i>Treatise upon Modern Instrumentation and Orchestration</i> (1856).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, EDWARD DANIEL<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1769-1822), English mineralogist
and traveller, was born at Willingdon, Sussex, on the 5th
of June 1769, and educated first at Tonbridge. In 1786 he obtained
the office of chapel clerk at Jesus College, Cambridge,
but the loss of his father at this time involved him in difficulties.
In 1790 he took his degree, and soon after became private tutor
to Henry Tufton, nephew of the duke of Dorset. In 1792 he
obtained an engagement to travel with Lord Berwick through
Germany, Switzerland and Italy. After crossing the Alps, and
visiting a few of the principal cities of Italy, including Rome,
he went to Naples, where he remained nearly two years. Having
returned to England in the summer of 1794, he became tutor
in several distinguished families. In 1799 he set out with a
Mr Cripps on a tour through the continent of Europe, beginning
with Norway and Sweden, whence they proceeded through
Russia and the Crimea to Constantinople, Rhodes, and afterwards
to Egypt and Palestine. After the capitulation of Alexandria,
Clarke was of considerable use in securing for England the
statues, sarcophagi, maps, manuscripts, &amp;c., which had been
collected by the French savants. Greece was the country next
visited. From Athens the travellers proceeded by land to
Constantinople, and after a short stay in that city directed
their course homewards through Rumelia, Austria, Germany
and France. Clarke, who had now obtained considerable reputation,
took up his residence at Cambridge. He received the
degree of LL.D. shortly after his return in 1803, on account
of the valuable donations, including a colossal statue of the
Eleusinian Ceres, which he had made to the university. He
was also presented to the college living of Harlton, near Cambridge,
in 1805, to which, four years later, his
father-in-law
added that of Yeldham. Towards the end of 1808 Dr Clarke
was appointed to the professorship of mineralogy in Cambridge,
then first instituted. Nor was his perseverance as a traveller
otherwise unrewarded. The MSS. which he had collected in the
course of his travels were sold to the Bodleian library for £1000;
and by the publication of his travels he realized altogether
a clear profit of £6595. Besides lecturing on mineralogy and
discharging his clerical duties, Dr Clarke eagerly prosecuted
the study of chemistry, and made several discoveries, principally
by means of the gas blow-pipe, which he had brought to a high
degree of perfection. He was also appointed university librarian
in 1817, and was one of the founders of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society in 1819. He died in London on the 9th of
March 1822. The following is a list of his principal works:&mdash;<i>Testimony
of Authors respecting the Colossal Statue of Ceres in
the Public Library, Cambridge</i> (8vo, 1801-1803); <i>The Tomb of
Alexander, a Dissertation on the Sarcophagus brought from Alexandria,
and now in the British Museum</i> (4to, 1805); <i>A Methodical
Distribution of the Mineral Kingdom</i> (fol., Lewes, 1807); <i>A
Description of the Greek Marbles brought from the Shores of the
Euxine, Archipelago and Mediterranean, and deposited in the
University Library, Cambridge</i> (8vo, 1809); <i>Travels in various
Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa</i> (4to, 1810-1819; 2nd ed.,
1811-1823).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, SIR EDWARD GEORGE<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), English
lawyer and politician, son of J.G. Clarke of Moorgate Street,
London, was born on the 15th of February 1841. In 1859 he
became a writer in the India office, but resigned in the next year,
and became a law reporter. He obtained a Tancred law scholarship
in 1861, and was called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1864.
He joined the home circuit, became Q.C. in 1880, and a bencher of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1882. In November 1877 he was successful in
securing the acquittal of Chief-Inspector Clarke from the charge
brought against certain Scotland Yard officials of conspiracy to
defeat justice, and his reputation was assured by his defence of
Patrick Staunton in the Penge murder case (1877), and of Mrs
Bartlett against the charge of poisoning her husband (1886).
Among other notable cases he was counsel for the plaintiff in the
libel action brought by Sir William Gordon-Cumming (1890)
against Mr and Mrs Lycett Green and others for slander, charging
him with cheating in the game of baccarat (in this case the prince
of Wales, afterwards Edward VII., gave evidence), and he
appeared for Dr Jameson, Sir John Willoughby and others when
they were tried (1896) under the Foreign Enlistment Act. He was
knighted in 1886. He was returned as Conservative member for
Southwark at a by-election early in 1880, but failed to retain his
seat at the general election which followed a month or two later;
he found a seat at Plymouth, however, which he retained until
1900. He was solicitor-general in the Conservative administration
of 1886-1892, but declined office under the Unionist government
of 1895 when the law officers of the crown were debarred
from private practice. The most remarkable, perhaps, of his
speeches in the House of Commons was his reply to Mr Gladstone
on the second reading of the Home Rule Bill in 1893. In 1899
differences which arose between Sir Edward Clarke and his party
on the subject of the government&rsquo;s South African policy led to
his resigning his seat. At the general election of 1906 he was
returned at the head of the poll for the city of London, but he
offended a large section of his constituents by a speech against
tariff reform in the House of Commons on the 12th of March, and
shortly afterwards he resigned his seat on grounds of health.
He published a <i>Treatise on the Law of Extradition</i> (4th ed., 1903),
and also three volumes of his political and forensic speeches.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, JAMES FREEMAN<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (1810-1888), American preacher
and author, was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, on the 4th of
April 1810. He was prepared for college at the public Latin
school of Boston, and graduated at Harvard College in 1829, and
at the Harvard Divinity School in 1833. He was then ordained
as minister of a Unitarian congregation at Louisville, Kentucky,
which was then a slave state. Clarke soon threw himself heart
and soul into the national movement for the abolition of slavery,
though he was never what was then called in America a &ldquo;radical
abolitionist.&rdquo; In 1839 he returned to Boston, where he and his
friends established (1841) the &ldquo;Church of the Disciples.&rdquo; It
brought together a body of men and women active and eager in
applying the Christian religion to the social problems of the day,
and he would have said that the feature which distinguished it
from any other church was that they also were ministers of the
highest religious life. Ordination could make no distinction
between him and them. Of this church he was the minister from
1841 until 1850 and from 1854 until his death. He was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>
secretary of the Unitarian Association and, in 1867-1871
professor of natural religion and Christian doctrine at Harvard.
From the beginning of his active life he wrote freely for the press.
From 1836 until 1839 he was editor of the <i>Western Messenger</i>, a
magazine intended to carry to readers in the Mississippi Valley
simple statements of &ldquo;liberal religion,&rdquo; involving what were then
the most radical appeals as to national duty, especially the
abolition of slavery. The magazine is now of value to collectors
because it contains the earliest printed poems of Ralph Waldo
Emerson, who was Clarke&rsquo;s personal friend. Most of Clarke&rsquo;s
earlier published writings were addressed to the immediate need
of establishing a larger theory of religion than that espoused
by people who were still trying to be Calvinists, people who
maintained what a good American phrase calls &ldquo;hard-shelled
churches.&rdquo; But it would be wrong to call his work controversial.
He was always declaring that the business of the Church is
Eirenic and not Polemic. Such books as <i>Orthodoxy: Its Truths
and Errors</i> (1866) have been read more largely by members of
orthodox churches than by Unitarians. In the great moral
questions of his time Clarke was a fearless and practical advocate
of the broadest statement of human rights. Without caring
much what company he served in, he could always be seen and
heard, a leader of unflinching courage, in the front rank of the
battle. He published but few verses, but at the bottom he was a
poet. He was a diligent and accurate scholar, and among the
books by which he is best known is one called <i>Ten Great Religions</i>
(2 vols., 1871-1883). Few Americans have done more than
Clarke to give breadth to the published discussion of the subjects
of literature, ethics and religious philosophy. Among his later
books are <i>Every-Day Religion</i> (1886) and <i>Sermons on the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer</i> (1888). He died at Jamaica Plain, Mass., on the 8th of
June 1888.</p>

was educated for the law. He made his first appearance in
Boston as Frank Hardy in <i>Paul Pry</i> in 1851. In 1859 he married
Asia Booth, daughter of Junius Brutus Booth, and he was
associated with his brother-in-law Edwin Booth in the management
of the Winter Garden theatre in New York, the Walnut
Street theatre in Philadelphia and the Boston theatre. In 1867
he went to London, where he made his first appearance at the St
James&rsquo;s as Major Wellington de Boots in Stirling Coynes&rsquo;s
<i>Everybody&rsquo;s Friend</i>, rewritten for him and called <i>The Widow&rsquo;s
Hunt</i>. His success was so great that he remained in England for
the rest of his life, except for four visits to America. Among his
favourite parts were Toodles, which ran for 200 nights at the
Strand, Dr Pangloss in <i>The Heir-at-law</i>, and Dr Ollapod in <i>The

Australian author, was born in London on the 24th of April 1846.
He was the only son of William Hislop Clarke, a barrister of the
Middle Temple who died in 1863. He emigrated forthwith to
Australia, where his uncle, James Langton Clarke, was a county
court judge. He was at first a clerk in the bank of Australasia,
but showed no business ability, and soon proceeded to learn
farming at a station on the Wimmera river, Victoria. He was
already writing stories for the <i>Australian Magazine</i>, when in 1867
he joined the staff of the Melbourne <i>Argus</i> through the introduction
of Dr Robert Lewins. He also became secretary (1872) to
the trustees of the Melbourne public library and later (1876)
assistant librarian. He founded in 1868 the Yorick Club, which
soon numbered among its members the chief Australian men of
letters. The most famous of his books is <i>For the Term of his
Natural Life</i> (Melbourne, 1874), a powerful tale of an Australian
penal settlement, which originally appeared in serial form in a
Melbourne paper. He also wrote <i>The Peripatetic Philosopher</i>
(1869), a series of amusing papers reprinted from <i>The Austral-asian;
Long Odds</i> (London, 1870), a novel; and numerous
comedies and pantomimes, the best of which was <i>Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star</i> (Theatre Royal, Melbourne; Christmas,
1873). He married an actress, Marian Dunn. In spite of his
popular success Clarke was constantly involved in pecuniary
difficulties, which are said to have hastened his death at
Melbourne on the 2nd of August 1881.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, MARY ANNE<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (c. 1776-1852), mistress of Frederick
duke of York, second son of George III., was born either in
London or at Oxford. Her father, whose name was Thompson,
seems to have been a tradesman in rather humble circumstances.
She married before she was eighteen, but Mr Clarke, the proprietor
of a stonemasonry business, became bankrupt, and she
left him. After other <i>liaisons</i>, she became in 1803 the mistress of
the duke of York, then commander-in-chief, maintaining a large
and expensive establishment in a fashionable district. The
duke&rsquo;s promised allowance was not regularly paid, and to escape
her financial difficulties Mrs Clarke trafficked in her protector&rsquo;s
position, receiving money from various promotion-seekers,
military, civil and even clerical, in return for her promise to secure
them the good services of the duke. Her procedure became a
public scandal, and in 1809 Colonel Wardle, M.P., brought eight
charges of abuse of military patronage against the duke in the
House of Commons, and a committee of inquiry was appointed,
before which Mrs Clarke herself gave evidence. The result of the
inquiry clearly established the charges as far as she was concerned,
and the duke of York was shown to have been aware of
what was being done, but to have derived no pecuniary benefit
himself. He resigned his appointment as commander-in-chief,
and terminated his connexion with Mrs Clarke, who subsequently
obtained from him a considerable sum in cash and a pension, as
the price for withholding the publication of his numerous letters
to her. Mrs Clarke died at Boulogne on the 21st of June 1852.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, SAMUEL<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (1675-1729), English philosopher and
divine, son of Edward Clarke, an alderman, who for several years
was parliamentary representative of the city of Norwich, was
born on the 11th of October 1675, and educated at the free school
of Norwich and at Caius College, Cambridge. The philosophy of
Descartes was the reigning system at the university; Clarke,
however, mastered the new system of Newton, and contributed
greatly to its extension by publishing an excellent Latin version
of the <i>Traité de physique</i> of Jacques Rohault (1620-1675) with
valuable notes, which he finished before he was twenty-two years
of age. The system of Rohault was founded entirely upon
Cartesian principles, and was previously known only through the
medium of a rude Latin version. Clarke&rsquo;s translation (1697)
continued to be used as a text-book in the university till supplanted
by the treatises of Newton, which it had been designed to
introduce. Four editions were issued, the last and best being
that of 1718. It was translated into English in 1723 by his
brother Dr John Clarke (1682-1757), dean of Sarum.</p>

<p>Clarke afterwards devoted himself to the study of Scripture in
the original, and of the primitive Christian writers. Having taken
holy orders, he became chaplain to John Moore (1646-1714),
bishop of Norwich, who was ever afterwards his friend and patron.
In 1699 he published two treatises,&mdash;one entitled <i>Three Practical
Essays on Baptism, Confirmation and Repentance</i>, and the other,
<i>Some Reflections on that part of a book called Amyntor, or a
Defence of Milton&rsquo;s Life, which relates to the Writings of the
Primitive Fathers, and, the Canon of the New Testament</i>. In 1701
he published <i>A Paraphrase upon the Gospel of St Matthew</i>, which
was followed, in 1702, by the <i>Paraphrases upon the Gospels of St
Mark and St Luke</i>, and soon afterwards by a third volume upon
St John. They were subsequently printed together in two
volumes and have since passed through several editions. He
intended to treat in the same manner the remaining books of the
New Testament, but his design was unfulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>446</span>
Meanwhile he had been presented by Bishop Moore to the
rectory of Drayton, near Norwich. As Boyle lecturer, he dealt in
1704 with the <i>Being and Attributes of God</i>, and in 1705 with the
<i>Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion</i>. These lectures, first
printed separately, were afterwards published together under the
title of <i>A Discourse concerning the Being and Attributes of God, the
Obligations of Natural Religion, and the Truth and Certainty of the
Christian Revelation, in opposition to Hobbes, Spinoza, the author
of the Oracles of Reason, and other Deniers of Natural and Revealed
Religion</i>.</p>

<p>In 1706 he wrote a refutation of Dr Henry Dodwell&rsquo;s views on
the immortality of the soul, and this drew him into controversy
with Anthony Collins. He also wrote at this time a translation of
Newton&rsquo;s <i>Optics</i>, for which the author presented him with £500.
In the same year through the influence of Bishop Moore, he
obtained the rectory of St Benet&rsquo;s, Paul&rsquo;s Wharf, London.
Soon afterwards Queen Anne appointed him one of her chaplains
in ordinary, and in 1709 presented him to the rectory of St
James&rsquo;s, Westminster. He then took the degree of doctor in
divinity, defending as his thesis the two propositions: <i>Nullum
fidei Christianae dogma, in Sacris Scripturis traditum, est rectae
rationi dissentaneum</i>, and <i>Sine actionum humanarum libertate
nulla potest esse religio</i>. During the same year, at the request of
the author, he revised Whiston&rsquo;s English translation of the
<i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>.</p>

<p>In 1712 he published a carefully punctuated and annotated
edition (folio 1712, octavo 1720) of Caesar&rsquo;s <i>Commentaries</i>, with
elegant engravings, dedicated to the duke of Marlborough.
During the same year he published his celebrated treatise on <i>The
Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</i>. It is divided into three parts.
The first contains a collection and exegesis of all the texts in the
New Testament relating to the doctrine of the Trinity; in the
second the doctrine is set forth at large, and explained in
particular and distinct propositions; and in the third the
principal passages in the liturgy of the Church of England
relating to the doctrine of the Trinity are considered. Whiston
informs us that, some time before the publication of this book,
a message was sent to him from Lord Godolphin &ldquo;that the
affairs of the public were with difficulty then kept in the hands of
those that were for liberty; that it was therefore an unseasonable
time for the publication of a book that would make a great noise
and disturbance; and that therefore they desired him to forbear
till a fitter opportunity should offer itself,&rdquo;&mdash;a message that
Clarke of course entirely disregarded. The ministers were right
in their conjectures; and the work not only provoked a great
number of replies, but occasioned a formal complaint from the
Lower House of Convocation. Clarke, in reply, drew up an
apologetic preface, and afterwards gave several explanations,
which satisfied the Upper House; and, on his pledging himself that
his future conduct would occasion no trouble, the matter dropped.</p>

<p>In 1715 and 1716 he had a discussion with Leibnitz relative
to the principles of natural philosophy and religion, which was
at length cut short by the death of his antagonist. A collection
of the papers which passed between them was published in 1717
(cf. G. v. Leroy, <i>Die philos. Probleme in dem Briefwechsel Leibniz
und Clarke</i>, Giessen, 1893). In 1719 he was presented by Nicholas
1st Baron Lechmere, to the mastership of Wigston&rsquo;s hospital
in Leicester. In 1724 he published seventeen sermons, eleven
of which had not before been printed. In 1727, on the death
of Sir Isaac Newton, he was offered by the court the place of
master of the mint, worth on an average from £1200 to £1500
a year. This secular preferment, however, he absolutely refused.
In 1728 was published &ldquo;A Letter from Dr Clarke to Benjamin
Hoadly, F.R.S., occasioned by the controversy relating to
the Proportion of Velocity and Force in Bodies in Motion,&rdquo;
printed in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>. In 1729 he published
the first twelve books of Homer&rsquo;s <i>Iliad</i>. This edition, dedicated
to William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, was highly praised
by Bishop Hoadly. On Sunday, the 11th of May 1729, when
going out to preach before the judges at Serjeants&rsquo; Inn, he was
seized with a sudden illness, which caused his death on the
Saturday following (May 17, 1729).</p>

<p>Soon after his death his brother Dr John Clarke, dean of
Sarum, published, from his original manuscripts, <i>An Exposition
of the Church Catechism</i>, and ten volumes of sermons. The
<i>Exposition</i> is composed of the lectures which he read every
Thursday morning, for some months in the year, at St James&rsquo;s
church. In the latter part of his life he revised them with great
care, and left them completely prepared for the press. Three
years after his death appeared also the last twelve books of the
<i>Iliad</i>, published by his son Samuel Clarke, the first three of these
books and part of the fourth having, as he states, been revised
and annotated by his father.</p>

<p>In disposition Clarke was cheerful and even playful. An
intimate friend relates that he once found him swimming
upon a table. At another time Clarke on looking out at the
window saw a grave blockhead approaching the house; upon
which he cried out, &ldquo;Boys, boys, be wise; here comes a fool.&rdquo;
Dr Warton, in his observations upon Pope&rsquo;s line,</p>

<p class="center1">&ldquo;Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">says, &ldquo;Who could imagine that Locke was fond of romances;
that Newton once studied astrology; that Dr Clarke valued
himself on his agility, and frequently amused himself in a
private room of his house in leaping over the tables and chairs?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Philosophy.</i>&mdash;Clarke, though in no way an original thinker, was
eminent in theology, mathematics, metaphysics and philology, but
his chief strength lay in his logical power. The materialism of
Hobbes, the pantheism of Spinoza, the empiricism of Locke, the
determinism of Leibnitz, Collins&rsquo; necessitarianism, Dodwell&rsquo;s denial
of the natural immortality of the soul, rationalistic attacks on
Christianity, and the morality of the sensationalists&mdash;all these he
opposed with a thorough conviction of the truth of the principles
which he advocated. His fame as theologian and philosopher rests
to a large extent on his demonstration of the existence of God and
his theory of the foundation of rectitude. The former is not a purely
a priori argument, nor is it presented as such by its author. It
starts from a fact and it often explicitly appeals to facts. The
intelligence, for example, of the self-existence and original cause of
all things is, he says, &ldquo;not easily proved a priori,&rdquo; but &ldquo;demonstrably
proved a posteriori from the variety and degrees of perfection
in things, and the order of causes and effects, from the intelligence
that created beings are confessedly endowed with, and from the
beauty, order, and final purpose of things.&rdquo; The propositions
maintained in the argument are&mdash;&ldquo;(1) That something has existed
from eternity; (2) that there has existed from eternity some one
immutable and independent being; (3) that that immutable and
independent being, which has existed from eternity, without any
external cause of its existence, must be self-existent, that is, necessarily
existing; (4) what the substance or essence of that being is,
which is self-existent or necessarily existing, we have no idea,
neither is it at all possible for us to comprehend it; (5) that though
the substance or essence of the self-existent being is itself absolutely
incomprehensible to us, yet many of the essential attributes of his
nature are strictly demonstrable as well as his existence, and, in
the first place, that he must be of necessity eternal; (6) that the
self-existent being must of necessity be infinite and omnipresent;
(7) must be but one; (8) must be an intelligent being; (9) must be
not a necessary agent, but a being endued with liberty and choice;
(10) must of necessity have infinite power; (11) must be infinitely
wise, and (12) must of necessity be a being of infinite goodness,
justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections, such as become the
supreme governor and judge of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In order to establish his sixth proposition, Clarke contends that
time and space, eternity and immensity, are not substances, but
attributes&mdash;the attributes of a self-existent being. Edmund Law,
Dugald Stewart, Lord Brougham, and many other writers, have,
in consequence, represented Clarke as arguing from the existence
of time and space to the existence of Deity. This is a serious mistake.
The existence of an immutable, independent, and necessary being
is supposed to be proved before any reference is made to the nature
of time and space. Clarke has been generally supposed to have
derived the opinion that time and space are attributes of an infinite
immaterial and spiritual being from the <i>Scholium Generale</i>, first
published in the second edition of Newton&rsquo;s <i>Principia</i> (1714). The
truth is that his work on the Being and Attributes of God appeared
nine years before that <i>Scholium</i>. The view propounded by Clarke
may have been derived from the Midrash, the Kabbalah, Philo,
Henry More, or Cudworth, but not from Newton. It is a view
difficult to prove, and probably few will acknowledge that Clarke
has conclusively proved it.</p>

<p>His ethical theory of &ldquo;fitness&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ethics</a></span>) is formulated on the
analogy of mathematics. He held that in relation to the will things
possess an objective fitness similar to the mutual consistency of
things in the physical universe. This fitness God has given to
actions, as he has given laws to Nature; and the fitness is as immutable
as the laws. The theory has been unfairly criticized by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>
Jouffroy, Amédée Jacques, Sir James Mackintosh, Thomas Brown
and others. It is said, for example, that Clarke made virtue consist
in conformity to the relations of things universally, although the
whole tenor of his argument shows him to have had in view conformity
to such relations only as belong to the sphere of moral
agency. It is true that he might have emphasized the relation of
moral fitness to the will, and in this respect J.F. Herbart (<i>q.v.</i>)
improved on Clarke&rsquo;s statement of the case. To say, however, that
Clarke simply confused mathematics and morals by justifying the
moral criterion on a mathematical basis is a mistake. He compared
the two subjects for the sake of the analogy.</p>

<p>Though Clarke can thus be defended against this and similar
criticism, his work as a whole can be regarded only as an attempt
to present the doctrines of the Cartesian school in a form which
would not shock the conscience of his time. His work contained
a measure of rationalism sufficient to arouse the suspicion of orthodox
theologians, without making any valuable addition to, or modification
of, the underlying doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, THOMAS SHIELDS<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (1860-&emsp;&emsp;), American artist,
was born in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on the 25th of April 1860,
and graduated at Princeton in 1882. He was a pupil of the Art
Students&rsquo; League, New York, and of the École des Beaux Arts,
Paris, under J.L. Gérôme; later he entered the atelier of
Dagnan-Bouveret, and, becoming interested in sculpture, worked
for a while under Henri M. Chapu. As a sculptor, he received
a medal of honour in Madrid for his &ldquo;The Cider Press,&rdquo;
now in the Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California, and
he made four caryatides of &ldquo;The Seasons&rdquo; for the Appellate
Court House, New York. He designed an &ldquo;Alma Mater&rdquo;

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARKE, WILLIAM BRANWHITE<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (1798-1878), British
geologist, was born at East Bergholt, in Suffolk, on the 2nd of
June 1798. He received his early education at Dedham grammar
school, and in 1817 entered Jesus College, Cambridge; he took
his B.A. in 1821, was ordained and became M.A. in 1824. In
1821 he was appointed curate of Ramsholt in Suffolk, and he
acted in his clerical capacity in other places until 1839. Having
become interested in geology through the teachings of Sedgwick,
he utilized his opportunities and gathered many interesting
facts on the geology of East Anglia which were embodied in a
paper &ldquo;On the Geological Structure and Phenomena of Suffolk&rdquo;
(<i>Trans. Geol. Soc.</i> 1837). He also communicated a series of
papers on the geology of S.E. Dorsetshire to the <i>Magazine of
Nat. Hist.</i> (1837-1838). In 1839, after a severe illness, he left
England for New South Wales, mainly with the object of benefiting
by the sea voyage. He remained, however, in that country,
and came to be regarded as the &ldquo;Father of Australian Geology.&rdquo;
From the date of his arrival in New South Wales until 1870 he
was in clerical charge first of the country from Paramatta to
the Hawkesbury river, then of Campbelltown, and finally of
Willoughby. He zealously devoted attention to the geology
of the country, with results that have been of paramount importance.
In 1841 he discovered gold, being the first explorer
who had obtained it <i>in situ</i> in the country, finding it both in the
detrital deposits and in the quartzites of the Blue Mountains,
and he then declared his belief in its abundance. In 1849 he
made the first actual discovery of tin in Australia and in 1859
he made known the occurrence of the diamond. He was also
the first to indicate the presence of Silurian rocks, and to determine
the age of the coal-bearing rocks in New South Wales.
In 1869 he announced the discovery of remains of <i>Dinornis</i> in
Queensland. He was a trustee of the Australian museum at
Sydney, and an active member of the Royal Society of New
South Wales. In 1860 he published <i>Researches in the Southern
Gold-fields of New South Wales</i>. He was elected F.R.S. in 1876,
and in the following year was awarded the Murchison medal
by the Geological Society of London. His contributions to
Australian scientific journals were numerous. He died near
Sydney, on the 17th of June 1878.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLARKSON, THOMAS<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1760-1846), English anti-slavery
agitator, was born on the 28th of March 1760, at Wisbeach, in
Cambridgeshire, where his father was headmaster of the free
grammar school. He was educated at St Paul&rsquo;s school and at
St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. Having taken the first place
among the middle bachelors as Latin essayist, he succeeded
in 1785 in gaining a similar honour among the senior bachelors.
The subject appointed by the vice-chancellor, Dr Peckhard, was
one in which he was himself deeply interested&mdash;<i>Anne liceat
invitos in servitutem dare?</i> (Is it right to make men slaves
against their will?). In preparing for this essay Clarkson
consulted a number of works on African slavery, of which the
chief was Benezet&rsquo;s <i>Historical Survey of New Guinea</i>; and
the atrocities of which he read affected him so deeply that he determined
to devote all his energies to effect the abolition of the
slave trade, and gave up his intention of entering the church.</p>

<p>His first measure was to publish, with additions, an English
translation of his prize essay (June 1786). He then commenced
to search in all quarters for information concerning slavery. He
soon discovered that the cause had already been taken up to
some extent by others, most of whom belonged to the Society of
Friends, and among the chief of whom were William Dillwyn,
Joseph Wood and Granville Sharp. With the aid of these
gentlemen, a committee of twelve was formed in May 1787 to do
all that was possible to effect the abolition of the slave trade.
Meanwhile Clarkson had also gained the sympathy of Wilberforce,
Whitbread, Sturge and several other men of influence. Travelling
from port to port, he now commenced to collect a large mass
of evidence; and much of it was embodied in his <i>Summary View
of the Slave Trade, and the Probable Consequences of its Abolition</i>,
which, with a number of other anti-slavery tracts, was published
by the committee. Pitt, Grenville, Fox and Burke looked
favourably on the movement; in May 1788 Pitt introduced a
parliamentary discussion on the subject, and Sir W. Dolben
brought forward a bill providing that the number of slaves
carried in a vessel should be proportional to its tonnage. A
number of Liverpool and Bristol merchants obtained permission
from the House to be heard by council against the bill, but on
the 18th of June it passed the Commons. Soon after Clarkson
published an <i>Essay on the Impolicy of the Slave Trade</i>; and for
two months he was continuously engaged in travelling that he
might meet men who were personally acquainted with the facts
of the trade. From their lips he collected a considerable amount
of evidence; but only nine could be prevailed upon to promise to
appear before the privy council. Meanwhile other witnesses had
been obtained by Wilberforce and the committee, and on the
12th of May 1789 the former led a debate on the subject in the
House of Commons, in which he was seconded by Burke and
supported by Pitt and Fox.</p>

<p>It was now the beginning of the French Revolution, and in the
hope that he might arouse the French to sweep away slavery with
other abuses, Clarkson crossed to Paris, where he remained six
months. He found Necker head of the government, and obtained
from him some sympathy but little help. Mirabeau, however,
with his assistance, prepared a speech against slavery, to be
delivered before the National Assembly, and the Marquis de la
Fayette entered enthusiastically into his views. During this
visit Clarkson met a deputation of negroes from Santo Domingo,
who had come to France to present a petition to the National
Assembly, desiring to be placed on an equal footing with the
whites; but the storm of the Revolution permitted no substantial
success to be achieved. Soon after his return home he
engaged in a search, the apparent hopelessness of which finely
displays his unshrinking laboriousness and his passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
enthusiasm. He desired to find some one who had himself
witnessed the capture of the negroes in Africa; and a friend
having met by chance a man-of-war&rsquo;s-man who had done so,
Clarkson, though ignorant of the name and address of the sailor,
set out in search of him, and actually discovered him. His last
tour was undertaken in order to form anti-slavery committees
in all the principal towns. At length, in the autumn of 1794,
his health gave way, and he was obliged to cease active work.
He now occupied his time in writing a <i>History of the Abolition
of the Slave Trade</i>, which appeared in 1808. The bill for the
abolition of the trade became law in 1807; but it was still
necessary to secure the assent of the other powers to its principle.
To obtain this was, under pressure of the public opinion created
by Clarkson and his friends, one of the main objects of British
diplomacy at the Congress of Vienna, and in February 1815 the
trade was condemned by the powers. The question of concerting
practical measures for its abolition was raised at the Congress of
Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, but without result. On this occasion
Clarkson personally presented an address to the emperor
Alexander I., who communicated it to the sovereigns of Austria
and Prussia. In 1823 the Anti-Slavery Society was formed,
and Clarkson was one of its vice-presidents. He was for some
time blind from cataract; but several years before his death
on the 26th of September 1846, his sight was restored.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Besides the works already mentioned, he published the <i>Portraiture
of Quakerism</i> (1806), <i>Memoirs of William Penn</i> (1813), <i>Researches,
Antediluvian, Patriarchal and Historical</i> (1836), intended as a history
of the interference of Providence for man&rsquo;s spiritual good, and
<i>Strictures</i> on several of the remarks concerning himself made in the
<i>Life of Wilberforce</i>, in which his claim as originator of the anti-slavery
movement is denied.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLARKSVILLE<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Montgomery
county, Tennessee, U.S.A., situated in the N. part of the state,
about 50 m. N.W. of Nashville, on the Cumberland river, at the
mouth of the Red river. Pop. (1890) 7924; (1900) 9431, of whom
5094 were negroes; (1910 census) 8548. It is served by the
Louisville &amp; Nashville, and the Illinois Central railways, and by
passenger and freight steamboat lines on the Cumberland river.
The city hall, and the public library are among the principal
public buildings, and the city is the seat of the Tennessee Odd
Fellows&rsquo; home, and of the South-Western Presbyterian University,
founded in 1875. Clarksville lies in the centre of the dark
tobacco belt&mdash;commonly known as the &ldquo;Black Patch&rdquo;&mdash;and is
an important tobacco market, with an annual trade in that
staple of about $4,000,000, most of the product being exported
to France, Italy, Austria and Spain. The city is situated in a
region well adapted for the growing of wheat, Indian corn, and
vegetables, and for the raising of live-stock; and Clarksville is a
shipping point for the lumber&mdash;chiefly oak, poplar and birch&mdash;and
the iron-ore of the surrounding country, a branch of the
Louisville &amp; Nashville railway extending into the iron district.
The city&rsquo;s principal manufactures are flour and grist mill products,
chewing and smoking tobacco and snuff, furniture, lumber, iron,
and pearl buttons. The value of the factory product in 1905 was
$2,210,112, being 32% greater than in 1900. The municipality
owns its water-works. Clarksville was first settled as early as
1780, was named in honour of General George Rogers Clark, and
was chartered as a city in 1850.</p>

applied (1) generally to an author of the first rank, and (2) more
particularly to a Greek or Roman author of that character.
Similarly, &ldquo;the classics&rdquo; is a synonym for the choicest products
of the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. It is to this
sense of the word that the following article is devoted in two
main divisions: (A) the general history of classical (<i>i.e.</i> Greek
and Latin) scholarship, and (B) its place in higher education.</p>

<p class="center1 sc">(A) General History of the Study of the Classics</p>

<p>We may consider this subject in four principal periods:&mdash;(i.) the
<i>Alexandrian</i>, c. 300-1 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; (ii.) the <i>Roman</i>, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> c. 1-530;
(iii.) the <i>Middle Ages</i>, c. 530-1350; and (iv.) the <i>Modern Age</i>,
c. 1350 to the present day.</p>

<p>(i.) <i>The Alexandrian Age.</i>&mdash;The study of the Greek classics
begins with the school of Alexandria. Under the rule of Ptolemy
Philadelphus (285-247 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), learning found a home in the
Alexandrian Museum and in the great Alexandrian Library.
The first four librarians were Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Aristophanes
of Byzantium, and Aristarchus. Zenodotus produced
before 274 the first scientific edition of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>,
an edition in which spurious lines were marked, at the beginning,
with a short horizontal dash called an <i>obelus</i> (&mdash;). He also drew
up select lists of epic and lyric poets. Soon afterwards a classified
catalogue of dramatists, epic and lyric poets, legislators, philosophers,
historians, orators and rhetoricians, and miscellaneous
writers, with a brief biography of each, was produced by the
scholar and poet Callimachus (fl. 260). Among the pupils of
Callimachus was Eratosthenes who, in 234, succeeded Zenodotus
as librarian. Apart from his special interest in the history of the
Old Attic comedy, he was a man of vast and varied learning;
the founder of astronomical geography and of scientific chronology;
and the first to assume the name of <span class="grk" title="philologos">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>. The
greatest philologist of antiquity was, however, his successor,
Aristophanes of Byzantium (195), who reduced accentuation
and punctuation to a definite system, and used a variety of
critical symbols in his recension of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. He
also edited Hesiod and Pindar, Euripides and Aristophanes,
besides composing brief introductions to the several plays, parts
of which are still extant. Lastly, he established a scientific
system of lexicography and drew up lists of the &ldquo;best authors.&rdquo;
Two critical editions of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were produced by
his successor, Aristarchus, who was librarian until 146 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and
was the founder of scientific scholarship. His distinguished
pupil, Dionysius Thrax (born c. 166 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), drew up a Greek
grammar which continued in use for more than thirteen centuries.
The most industrious of the successors of Aristarchus was
Didymus (c. 65 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 10), who, in his work on the Homeric
poems, aimed at restoring the lost recensions of Aristarchus.
He also composed commentaries on the lyric and comic poets
and on Thucydides and Demosthenes; part of his commentary
on this last author was first published in 1904. He was a teacher
in Alexandria (and perhaps also in Rome); and his death,
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 10, marks the close of the Alexandrian age. He
is the industrious compiler who gathered up the remnants of
the learning of his predecessors and transmitted them to posterity.
The poets of that age, including Callimachus and Theocritus,
were subsequently expounded by Theon, who flourished under
Tiberius, and has been well described as &ldquo;the Didymus of the
Alexandrian poets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Alexandrian canon of the Greek classics, which probably
had its origin in the lists drawn up by Callimachus, Aristophanes
of Byzantium and Aristarchus, included the following authors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Epic poets</i> (5): Homer, Hesiod, Peisander, Panyasis, Antimachus.</p>

<p><i>Iambic poets</i> (3): Simonides of Amorgos, Archilochus, Hipponax.</p>

<p><i>Tragic poets</i> (5): Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Ion, Achaeus.</p>

<p><i>Comic poets, Old</i> (7): Epicharmus, Cratinus, Eupolis, Aristophanes,
Pherecrates, Crates, Plato. <i>Middle</i> (2): Antiphanes, Alexis.
<i>New</i> (5): Menander, Philippides, Diphilus, Philemon, Apollodorus.</p>

<p><i>Elegiac poets</i> (4):  Callinus, Mimnermus, Philetas, Callimachus.</p>

<p><i>Lyric poets</i> (9): Alcman, Alcaeus, Sappho, Stesichorus, Pindar,
Bacchylides, Ibycus, Anacreon, Simonides of Ceos.</p>

<p><i>Orators</i> (10): Demosthenes, Lysias, Hypereides, Isocrates,
Aeschines, Lycurgus, Isaeus, Antiphon, Ándocides, Deinarchus.</p>

<p><i>Historians</i> (10): Thucydides, Herodotus, Xenophon, Philistius,
Theopompus, Ephorus, Anaximenes, Callisthenes, Hellanicus, Polybius.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span></p>

<p>The latest name in the above list is that of Polybius, who
died about 123 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Apollonius Rhodius, Aratus and Theocritus
were subsequently added to the &ldquo;epic&rdquo; poets. Philosophers,
such as Plato and Aristotle, were possibly classed in a separate
&ldquo;canon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the scholars of Alexandria were mainly interested in
the <i>verbal criticism</i> of the Greek <i>poets</i>, a wider variety of studies
was the characteristic of the school of Pergamum, the literary
rival of Alexandria. Pergamum was a home of learning for a
large part of the 150 years of the Attalid dynasty, 283-133 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The grammar of the Stoics, gradually elaborated by Zeno,
Cleanthes and Chrysippus, supplied a terminology which, in
words such as &ldquo;genitive,&rdquo; &ldquo;accusative&rdquo; and &ldquo;aorist,&rdquo; has
become a permanent part of the grammarian&rsquo;s vocabulary;
and the study of this grammar found its earliest home in Pergamum.</p>

<p>From about 168 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the head of the Pergamene school was
Crates of Mallus, who (like the Stoics) was an adherent of the
principle of &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; in grammar, and was thus opposed
to Aristarchus of Alexandria, the champion of &ldquo;analogy.&rdquo;
He also opposed Aristarchus, and supported the Stoics, by
insisting on an <i>allegorical</i> interpretation of Homer. He is
credited with having drawn up the classified lists of the best
authors for the Pergamene library. His mission as an envoy
to the Roman senate, &ldquo;shortly after the death of Ennius&rdquo; in
169 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, had a remarkable influence on literary studies in Rome.
Meeting with an accident while he was wandering on the Palatine,
and being detained in Rome, he passed part of his enforced
leisure in giving lectures (possibly on Homer, his favourite
author), and thus succeeded in arousing among the Romans a
taste for the scholarly study of literature. The example set by
Crates led to the production of a new edition of the epic poem
of Naevius, and to the public recitation of the <i>Annals</i> of Ennius,
and (two generations later) the <i>Satires</i> of Lucilius.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>The Roman Age.</i>&mdash;(a) <i>Latin Studies.</i>&mdash;In the 1st century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> the foremost scholar in Rome was L. Aelius Stilo (c. 154-c. 74),
who is described by Cicero as profoundly learned in Greek
and Latin literature, and as an accomplished critic of Roman
antiquities and of ancient authors. Of the plays then passing
under the name of Plautus, he recognized twenty-five as genuine.
His most famous pupil was Varro (116-27), the six surviving
books of whose great work on the Latin language are mainly
concerned with the great grammatical controversy on analogy
and anomaly&mdash;a controversy which also engaged the attention
of Cicero and Caesar, and of the elder Pliny and Quintilian.
The twenty-one plays of Plautus accepted by Varro are doubtless
the twenty now extant, together with the lost <i>Vidularia</i>. The
influence of Varro&rsquo;s last work on the nine <i>disciplinae</i>, or branches
of study, long survived in the seven &ldquo;liberal arts&rdquo; recognized
by St Augustine and Martianus Capella, and in the <i>trivium</i> and
<i>quadrivium</i> of the middle ages.</p>

<p>Part of Varro&rsquo;s treatise on Latin was dedicated to Cicero (106-43),
who as an interpreter of Greek philosophy to his fellow-countrymen
enlarged the vocabulary of Latin by his admirable
renderings of Greek philosophical terms, and thus ultimately
gave us such indispensable words as &ldquo;species,&rdquo; &ldquo;quality&rdquo; and
&ldquo;quantity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earliest of Latin lexicons was produced about 10 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by
Verrius Flaccus in a work, <i>De Verborum Significatu</i>, which
survived in the abridgment by Festus (2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>) and in
the further abridgment dedicated by Paulus Diaconus to Charles
the Great.</p>

<p>Greek models were diligently studied by Virgil and Horace.
Their own poems soon became the theme of criticism and of
comment; and, by the time of Quintilian and Juvenal, they
shared the fate (which Horace had feared) of becoming text-books
for use in schools.</p>

<p>Recensions of Terence, Lucretius and Persius, as well as
Horace and Virgil, were produced by Probus (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 88), with
critical symbols resembling those invented by the Alexandrian
scholars. His contemporary Asconius is best known as the
author of an extant historical commentary on five of the speeches
of Cicero. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 88 Quintilian was placed at the head of the first
state-supported school in Rome. His comprehensive work on
the training of the future orator includes an outline of general
education, which had an important influence on the humanistic
schools of the Italian Renaissance. It also presents us with a
critical survey of the Greek and Latin classics arranged under the
heads of poets, historians, orators and philosophers (book x.
chap. i.). The lives of Roman poets and scholars were among the
many subjects that exercised the literary skill of Hadrian&rsquo;s
private secretary, Suetonius. One of his lost works is the
principal source of the erudition of Isidore of Seville (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 636),
whose comprehensive encyclopaedia was a favourite text-book in
the middle ages. About the time of the death of Suetonius (<span class="scs">A.D.</span>
160) a work entitled the <i>Noctes Atticae</i> was begun by Aulus
Gellius. The author is an industrious student and a typical
scholar, who frequents libraries and is interested in the MSS.
of old Latin authors. Early in the 4th century the study of
grammar was represented in northern Africa by the Numidian
tiro, Nonius Marcellus (fl. 323), the author of an encyclopaedic
work in three parts, lexicographical, grammatical and antiquarian,
the main value of which lies in its quotations from early Latin
literature. About the middle of the same century grammar had a
far abler exponent at Rome in the person of Aelius Donatus, the
preceptor of St Jerome, as well as the author of a text-book that
remained in use throughout the middle ages. The general state
of learning in this century is illustrated by Ausonius (c. 310-393),
the grammarian and rhetorician of Bordeaux, the author of the
<i>Mosella</i>, and the probable inspirer of the memorable decree of
Gratian (376), providing for the appointment and the payment of
teachers of rhetoric and of Greek and Latin literature in the
principal cities of Gaul. His distinguished friend, Q. Aurelius
Symmachus, the consul of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 391, aroused in his own immediate
circle an interest in Livy, the whole of whose history was still
extant. Early in the 5th century other aristocratic Romans
interested themselves in the textual criticism of Persius and
Martial. Among the contemporaries of Symmachus, the devoted
adherent of the old Roman religion, was St Jerome (d. 420), the
most scholarly representative of Christianity in the 4th century,
the student of Plautus and Terence, of Virgil and Cicero, the
translator of the <i>Chronology</i> of Eusebius, and the author of the
Latin version of the Bible now known as the Vulgate. St
Augustine (d. 430) confesses to his early fondness for Virgil, and
also tells us that he received his first serious impressions from the
<i>Hortensius</i> of Cicero, an eloquent exhortation to the study of
philosophy, of which only a few fragments survive. In his
survey of the &ldquo;liberal arts&rdquo; St Augustine imitates (as we have
seen) the <i>Disciplinae</i> of Varro, and in the greatest of his works,
the <i>De Civitate Dei</i> (426), he has preserved large portions of the
<i>Antiquitates</i> of Varro and the <i>De Republica</i> of Cicero. About the
same date, and in the same province of northern Africa, Martianus
Capella produced his allegorical work on the &ldquo;liberal arts,&rdquo; the
principal, and, indeed, often the only, text-book of the medieval
schools.</p>

<p>In the second half of the 5th century the foremost representative
of Latin studies in Gaul was Apollinaris Sidonius (fl. 470),
whose <i>Letters</i> were modelled on those of the younger Pliny, while
his poems give proof of a wide though superficial acquaintance
with classical literature. He laments the increasing decline in
the classical purity of the Latin language.</p>

<p>An interest in Latin literature lived longest in Gaul, where
schools of learning flourished as early as the 1st century
at Autun, Lyons, Toulouse, Nîmes, Vienne, Narbonne and
Marseilles; and, from the 3rd century onwards, at Trier, Poitiers,
Besançon and Bordeaux.</p>

<p>About ten years after the death of Sidonius we find Asterius,
the consul of 494, critically revising the text of Virgil in Rome.
Boëthius, who early in life formed the ambitious plan of expounding
and reconciling the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, continued
in the year of his sole consulship (510) to instruct his fellow-countrymen
in the wisdom of Greece. He is a link between the
ancient world and the middle ages, having been the last of the
learned Romans who understood the language and studied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>
literature of Greece, and the first to interpret to the middle ages
the logical treatises of Aristotle. He thereby gave the signal for
the age-long conflict between Nominalism and Realism, which
exercised the keenest intellects among the Schoolmen, while the
crowning work of his life, the <i>Consolatio Philosophiae</i> (524), was
repeatedly expounded and imitated, and reproduced in renderings
that were among the earliest literary products of the vernacular
languages of modern Europe. His contemporary, Cassiodorus
(c. 480-c. 575), after spending thirty years in the service of the
Ostrogothic dynasty at Ravenna, passed the last thirty-three
years of his long life on the shores of the Bay of Squillace, where
he founded two monasteries and diligently trained their inmates to
become careful copyists. In his latest work he made extracts for
their benefit from the pages of Priscian (fl. 512), a transcript of
whose great work on Latin grammar was completed at Constantinople
by one of that grammarian&rsquo;s pupils in 527, to be reproduced
in a thousand MSS. in the middle ages. More than ten
years before Cassiodorus founded his monasteries in the south of
Italy, Benedict of Nursia (480-543) had rendered a more
permanent service to the cause of scholarship by building,
amid the ruins of the temple of Apollo on the crest of Monte
Cassino, the earliest of those homes of learning that have
lent an undying distinction to the Benedictine order. The
learned labours of the Benedictines were no part of the original
requirements of the rule of St Benedict; but before the founder&rsquo;s
death his favourite disciple had planted a monastery in France,
and the name of that disciple is permanently associated with the
learned labours of the Benedictines of the Congregation of St
Maur (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maurists</a></span>).</p>

<p>(b) <i>Greek Studies.</i>&mdash;Meanwhile, the study of the Greek classics
was ably represented at Rome in the Augustan age by Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (fl. 30-8 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the intelligent critic of the
ancient Attic orators, while the 1st century of our era is the
probable date of the masterpiece of literary criticism known as
the treatise <i>On the Sublime</i> by Longinus (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The 2nd century is the age of the two great grammarians,
Apollonius Dyscolus (the founder of scientific grammar and
the creator of the study of Greek syntax) and his son Herodian,
the larger part of whose principal work dealt with the subject
of Greek accentuation. It is also the age of the lexicographers
of Attic Greek, the most important of whom are Phrynichus,
Pollux (fl. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 180) and Harpocration.</p>

<p>In the 4th century Demosthenes was expounded and imitated
by the widely influential teacher, Libanius of Antioch (c. 314-c.
393), the pagan preceptor of St Chrysostom. To the same
century we may assign the grammarian Theodosius of Alexandria,
who, instead of confining himself (like Dionysius Thrax) to the
tenses of <span class="grk" title="thuptô">&#964;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#969;</span> in actual use, was the first to set forth all the
imaginary aorists and futures of that verb, which have thence
descended through the Byzantine age to the grammars of the
Renaissance and of modern Europe.</p>

<p>In the 5th century we may place Hesychius of Alexandria,
the compiler of the most extensive of our ancient Greek lexicons,
and Proclus, the author of a chrestomathy, to the extracts
from which (as preserved by Photius) we owe almost all our
knowledge of the contents of the lost epics of early Greece.
In the same century the study of Plato was represented by
Synesius of Cyrene (c. 370-c. 413) and by the Neoplatonists of
Alexandria and of Athens. The lower limit of the Roman age
of classical studies may be conveniently placed in the year 529.
In that year the monastery of Monte Cassino was founded in
the West, while the school of Athens was closed in the East.
The Roman age thus ends in the West with Boëthius, Cassiodorus
and St Benedict, and in the East with Priscian and
Justinian.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>The Middle Ages</i>.&mdash;(a) <i>In the East</i>, commonly called
the <i>Byzantine Age</i>, c. 530-1350. In this age, grammatical
learning was represented by Choeroboscus, and lexicography by
Photius (d. 891), the patriarch of Constantinople, who is also
the author of a <i>Bibliotheca</i> reviewing and criticizing the contents
of 280 MSS., and incidentally preserving important extracts
from the lost Greek historians.</p>

<p>In the time of Photius the poets usually studied at school were
Homer, Hesiod, Pindar; certain select plays of Aeschylus
(<i>Prometheus, Septem</i> and <i>Persae</i>), Sophocles (<i>Ajax, Electra</i>
and <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>), and Euripides (<i>Hecuba, Orestes, Phoenissae</i>,
and, next to these, <i>Alcestis, Andromache, Hippolytus,
Medea, Rhesus, Troades</i>,) also Aristophanes (beginning with the
<i>Plutus</i>), Theocritus, Lycophron, and Dionysius Periegetes.
The principal prose authors were Thucydides, parts of Plato
and Demosthenes, with Aristotle, Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Lives</i>, and, above all,
Lucian, who is often imitated in the Byzantine age.</p>

<p>One of the distinguished pupils of Photius, Arethas, bishop of
Caesarea in Cappadocia (c. 907-932), devoted himself with
remarkable energy to collecting and expounding the Greek
classics. Among the important MSS. still extant that were
copied at his expense are the Bodleian Euclid (888) and the
Bodleian Plato (895). To the third quarter of the 10th century
we may assign the Greek lexicon of Suïdas, a combination of a
lexicon and an encyclopaedia, the best articles being those on
the history of literature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the &ldquo;dark age&rdquo; of secular learning at
Constantinople (641-850), the light of Greek learning had spread
eastwards to Syria and Arabia. At Bagdad, in the reign of
Mamun (813-833), the son of Harun al-Rashid, philosophical
works were translated by Syrian Christians from Greek into
Syriac and from Syriac into Arabic. It was in his reign that
Aristotle was first translated into Arabic, and, shortly afterwards,
we have Syriac and Arabic renderings of commentators on
Aristotle, and of portions of Plato, Hippocrates and Galen;
while in the 10th century new translations of Aristotle and his
commentators were produced by the Nestorian Christians.</p>

<p>The Arabic translations of Aristotle passed from the East
to the West by being transmitted through the Arab dominions
in northern Africa to Spain, which had been conquered by the
Arabs in the 8th century. In the 12th century Toledo was the
centre of the study of Aristotle in the West, and it was from
Toledo that the knowledge of Aristotle spread to Paris and to
other seats of learning in western Europe.</p>

<p>The 12th century in Constantinople is marked by the name
of Tzetzes (c. 1110-c. 1180), the author of a mythological,
literary and historical miscellany called the <i>Chiliades</i>, in the
course of which he quotes more than four hundred authors.
The prolegomena to his scholia on Aristophanes supply us with
valuable information on the Alexandrian libraries. The most
memorable name, however, among the scholars of this century
is that of Eustathius, whose philological studies at Constantinople
preceded his tenure of the archbishopric of Thessalonica (1175-1192).
The opening pages of his commentaries on the <i>Iliad</i> and
the <i>Odyssey</i> dwell with enthusiasm on the abiding influence of
Homer on the literature of Greece.</p>

<p>While the Byzantine MSS. of the 11th century (such as the
Laurentian MSS. of Aeschylus and Sophocles, and the Ravenna
MS. of Aristophanes) maintain the sound traditions of the
Alexandrian and Roman ages, those of the times of the Palaeologi
give proof of a frequent tampering with the metres of the ancient
poets in order to bring them into conformity with theories
recently invented by Moschopulus and Triclinius. The scholars
of these times are the natural precursors of the earliest representatives
of the Revival of Learning in the West. Of these
later Byzantines the first in order of date is the monk Planudes
(d. 1330), who devoted his knowledge of Latin to producing
excellent translations of Caesar&rsquo;s <i>Gallic War</i> as well as Ovid&rsquo;s
<i>Metamorphoses</i> and <i>Heroides</i>, and the classic work of Boëthius;
he also compiled (in 1302) the only Greek anthology known to
scholars before the recovery in 1607 of the earlier and fuller
anthology of Cephalas (fl. 917).</p>

<p>The scholars of the Byzantine age cannot be compared with
the great Alexandrians, but they served to maintain the continuity
of tradition by which the Greek classics selected by the
critics of Alexandria were transmitted to modern Europe.</p>

<p>(b) <i>In the West</i> (c. 530-c. 1350).&mdash;At the portal of the middle
ages stands Gregory the Great (c. 540-604), who had little (if any)
knowledge of Greek and had no sympathy with the <i>secular</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
side of the study of Latin. A decline in grammatical learning
is exemplified in the three Latin historians of the 6th century,
Jordanes, Gildas and Gregory of Tours (d. 594), who begins
his history of the Franks by lamenting the decay of Latin
literature in Gaul. The historian of Tours befriended the Latin
poet, Venantius Fortunatus (d. <i>c.</i> 600), who is still remembered
as the writer of the three well-known hymns beginning <i>Salve
festa dies</i>, <i>Vexilla regis prodeunt</i>, and <i>Pange lingua gloriosi
proelium certaminis</i>. The decadence of Latin early in the 7th
century is exemplified by the fantastic grammarian Virgilius
Maro, who also illustrates the transition from Latin to Provençal,
and from quantitive to accentual forms of verse.</p>

<p>While Latin was declining in Gaul, even Greek was not
unknown in Ireland, and the Irish passion for travel led to the
spread of Greek learning in the west of Europe. The Irish monk
Columban, shortly before his death in 615, founded in the
neighbourhood of Pavia the monastery of Bobbio, to be the
repository of many Latin MSS. which were ultimately dispersed
among the libraries of Rome, Milan and Turin. About the same
date his fellow-traveller, Gallus, founded above the Lake of
Constance the monastery of St Gallen, where Latin MSS. were
preserved until their recovery in the age of the Renaissance.
During the next twenty-five years Isidore of Seville (d. 636)
produced in his <i>Origines</i> an encyclopaedic work which gathered
up for the middle ages much of the learning of the ancient world.</p>

<p>In Italy a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the 5th and 6th
centuries led to an estrangement between the Greek and Latin
Churches. The year 690 is regarded as the date of the temporary
extinction of Greek in Italy, but, in the first quarters of the 8th
and the 9th centuries, the iconoclastic decrees of the Byzantine
emperors drove many of the Greek monks and their lay adherents
to the south of Italy, and even to Rome itself.</p>

<p>In Ireland we find Greek characters used in the Book of
Armagh (<i>c.</i> 807); and, in the same century, a Greek psalter was
copied by an Irish monk of Liége, named Sedulius (fl. 850), who
had a wide knowledge of Latin literature. In England, some
sixty years after the death of Augustine, the Greek archbishop
of Canterbury, Theodore of Tarsus (d. 690) founded a school for
the study of Greek, and with the help of an African monk named
Hadrian made many of the English monasteries schools of Greek
and Latin learning, so that, in the time of Bede (d. 735), some of
the scholars who still survived were &ldquo;as familiar with Greek and
Latin as with their mother-tongue.&rdquo; Among those who had
learned their Greek at Canterbury was Aldhelm (d. 709), &ldquo;the
first Englishman who cultivated classical learning with any
success.&rdquo; While Aldhelm is known as &ldquo;the father of Anglo-Latin
verse,&rdquo; Latin prose was the literary medium used by Bede
in his celebrated <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> of England (731). Nine
years after the death of Bede (735), Boniface, &ldquo;the apostle of
Germany,&rdquo; sanctioned the founding of Fulda (744), which soon
rivalled St Gallen as a school of learning. Alcuin (d. 804), who
was probably born in the year of Bede&rsquo;s death, tells us of the
wealth of Latin literature preserved in the library at York.
Through the invitation of Charles the Great, he became associated
with the revival of learning which marks the reign of that
monarch, by presiding over the School of the Palace (782-790),
and by exercising a healthy influence as abbot of St Martin&rsquo;s at
Tours (796-804). Among the friends of Alcuin and the advisers
of Charles was Theodulfus, bishop of Orleans and abbot of
Fleury (d. 821), who is memorable as an accomplished Latin
poet, and as the initiator of free education. Einhard (d. 840), in
his classic life of Charles the Great, models his style on that of
Suetonius, and shows his familiarity with Caesar and Livy and
Cicero, while Rabanus Maurus (d. 856), who long presided over
Einhard&rsquo;s school of Fulda, was the first to introduce Priscian into
the schools of Germany. His pupil, Walafrid Strabo, the abbot of
Reichenau (d. 849), had a genuine gift for Latin poetry, a gift
agreeably exemplified in his poem on the plants in the monastic
garden. In the same century an eager interest in the Latin
classics is displayed by Servatus Lupus, who was educated at
Fulda, and was abbot of Ferrières for the last twenty years of his
life (d. 862). In his literary spirit he is a precursor of the
humanists of the Renaissance. Under Charles the Bald (d. 877)
there was a certain revival of interest in literature, when John
the Scot (Erigena) became, for some thirty years (c. 845-875),
the head of the Palace School. He was familiar with the Greek
Fathers, and was chosen to execute a Latin rendering of the
writings of &ldquo;Dionysius the Areopagite,&rdquo; the patron saint of
France. In the preface the translator praises the king for
prompting him not to rest satisfied with the literature of the West,
but to have recourse to the &ldquo;most pure and copious waters of the
Greeks.&rdquo; In the next generation Remi of Auxerre was the first to
open a school in Paris (900). Virgil is the main authority quoted
in Remi&rsquo;s Commentary on Donatus, which remained in use until
the Renaissance. During the two centuries after John the Scot,
the study of Greek declined in France. In England the 9th
century closes with Alfred, who, with the aid of the Welsh monk,
Asser, produced a series of free translations from Latin texts,
including Boëthius and Orosius and Bede, and the <i>Cura Pastoralis</i>
of Gregory the Great.</p>

<p>In the 10th century learning flourished at Aachen under Bruno,
brother of Otto I. and archbishop of Cologne (953-965), who had
himself learned Greek from certain Eastern monks at the imperial
court, and who called an Irish bishop from Trier to teach Greek at
the imperial capital. He also encouraged the transcription of
Latin MSS., which became models of style to Widukind of
Corvey, the imitator of Sallust and Livy. In the same century
the monastery of Gandersheim, south of Hanover, was the
retreat of the learned nun Hroswitha, who celebrated the
exploits of Otho in leonine hexameters, and composed in prose
six moral and religious plays in imitation of Terence. One of the
most prominent personages of the century was Gerbert of
Aurillac, who, after teaching at Tours and Fleury, became abbot
of Bobbio, archbishop of Reims, and ultimately pope under the
name of Silvester II. (d. 1003). He frequently quotes from the
speeches of Cicero, and it has been surmised that the survival of
those speeches may have been due to the influence of Gerbert.
The most original hellenist of this age is Luitprand, bishop of
Cremona (d. 972), who acquired some knowledge of Greek during
his repeated missions to Constantinople. About the same time
in England Oswald of York, who had himself been educated at
Fleury, invited Abbo (d. 1004) to instruct the monks of the abbey
recently founded at Ramsey, near Huntingdon. At Ramsey he
wrote for his pupils a scholarly work dealing with points of
prosody and pronunciation, and exhibiting an accurate knowledge
of Virgil and Horace. During the same half-century, Ælfric,
the abbot of Eynsham (d. c. 1030), aided Bishop Æthelwold
in making Winchester famous as a place of education. It was there
that he began his <i>Latin Grammar</i>, his <i>Glossary</i> (the
earliest Latin-English dictionary in existence), and his <i>Colloquium</i>,
in which Latin is taught in a conversational manner.</p>

<p>In France, the most notable teacher in the first quarter of the
11th century was Fulbert, bishop of Chartres (d. 1029). In and
after the middle of that century the Norman monastery of Bec
flourished under the rule of Lanfranc and Anselm, both of whom
had begun their career in northern Italy, and closed it at Canterbury.
Meanwhile, in Germany, the styles of Sallust and Livy were
being happily imitated in the <i>Annals</i> of Lambert of Hersfeld
(d. 1077). In Italy, where the study of Latin literature seems
never to have entirely died out, young nobles and students
preparing for the priesthood were not infrequently learning
Latin together, in private grammar schools under liberal clerics,
such as Anselm of Bisate (fl. 1050), who describes himself as
divided in his allegiance between the saints and the muses.
Learning flourished at Monte Cassino under the rule of the Abbot
Desiderius (afterwards Pope Victor III.). In this century that
famous monastery had its classical chronicler in Leo Marsicanus,
and its Latin poet in Alfanus, the future archbishop of Salerno.</p>

<p>The Schoolmen devoted most of their attention to Aristotle,
and we may here briefly note the successive stages in their
gradually increasing knowledge of his works. Until 1128 only
the first two of the five parts of the <i>Organon</i> were known, and
those solely in Latin translations from the original. After that
date two more became known; the whole was familiar to John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>
of Salisbury in 1159; while the <i>Physics</i> and <i>Metaphysics</i> came
into notice about 1200. Plato was mainly represented by the
Latin translation of the <i>Timaeus</i>. Abelard (d. 1142) was
acquainted with no Greek works except in Latin translations,
but he has left his mark on the history of European education.
The wide popularity of his brilliant lectures in the &ldquo;schools&rdquo;
of Paris made this city the resort of the many students who
were ultimately organized as a &ldquo;university&rdquo; (c. 1170). John of
Salisbury attended Abelard&rsquo;s lectures in 1136, and, after spending
two years in the study of logic in Paris, passed three more in the
scholarly study of Latin literature at Chartres, where a sound
and healthy tradition, originally due to Bernard of Chartres
(fl. 1120), was still perpetuated by his pupils. In that school the
study of &ldquo;figures of speech&rdquo; was treated as merely introductory
to that of the classical texts. Stress was laid on the sense as
well as the style of the author studied. Discussions on set
subjects were held, select passages from the classics learned
by heart, while written exercises in prose and verse were founded
on the best ancient models. In the general scheme of education
the authority followed was Quintilian. John of Salisbury
(d. 1180), the ripest product of this school, is the most learned
man of his time. His favourite author is Cicero, and in all the
Latin literature accessible to him he is the best-read scholar of
his age. Among Latin scholars of the next generation we have
Giraldus Cambrensis (d. c. 1222), the author of topographical
and historical writings on Ireland and Wales, and of other works
teeming with quotations from the Latin classics. During the
middle ages Latin prose never dies out. It is the normal language
of literature. In England it is used by many chroniclers and
historians, the best known of whom are William of Malmesbury
(d. 1142) and Matthew Paris (d. 1259). In Italy Latin verse
had been felicitously applied to historic themes by William of
Apulia (fl. 1100) and other Latin poets (1088-1247). In the
12th century England claims at least seven Latin poets, one of
these being her only Latin epic poet, Joseph of Exeter (d. 1210),
whose poem on the Trojan war is still extant. The Latin versifier,
John of Garlandia, an Englishman who lived mainly in France
(fl. 1204-1252), produced several Latin vocabularies which were
still in use in the boyhood of Erasmus. The Latin poets of French
birth include Gautier and Alain de Lille (d. c. 1203), the former
being the author of the <i>Alexandreis</i>, and the latter that of the
<i>Anti-Claudianus</i>, a poem familiar to Chaucer.</p>

<p>During the hundred and thirty years that elapsed between
the early translations of Aristotle executed at Toledo about
1150 and the death in 1281 of William of Moerbeke, the translator
of the <i>Rhetoric</i> and the <i>Politics</i>, the knowledge of
Aristotle had been greatly extended in Europe by means of translations,
first from the Arabic, and, next, from the original Greek.
Aristotle had been studied in England by Grosseteste (d. 1253),
and expounded abroad by the great Dominican, Albertus
Magnus (d. 1280), and his famous pupil, Thomas Aquinas
(d. 1274). Among the keenest critics of the Schoolmen and of
the recent translations of Aristotle was Roger Bacon (d. 1294),
whose <i>Opus majus</i> has been recognized as the <i>Encyclopédie</i>
and the <i>Organon</i> of the 13th century. His knowledge of Greek, as
shown in his <i>Greek Grammar</i> (first published in 1902), was
clearly derived from the Greeks of his own day. The medieval
dependence on the authority of Aristotle gradually diminished.
This was partly due to the recovery of some of the lost works
of ancient literature, and the transition from the middle ages
to the revival of learning was attended by a general widening
of the range of classical studies and by a renewed interest in Plato.</p>

<p>The classical learning of the middle ages was largely second-hand.
It was often derived from glossaries, from books of
elegant extracts, or from comprehensive encyclopaedias. Among
the compilers of these last were Isidore and Hrabanus, William
of Conches and Honorius of Autun, Bartholomaeus Anglicus
(fl. 1250), Vincent of Beauvais (d. 1264), and, lastly, Brunetto
Latini (d. 1290), the earlier contemporary of Dante. For
Aristotle, as interpreted by Albertus Magnus and Thomas
Aquinas, Dante has the highest regard. To the Latin translations
of Aristotle and to his interpreters he refers in more than
three hundred passages, while the number of his references to
the Latin translation of the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato is less than
ten. His five great pagan poets are Homer, Virgil, Horace,
Ovid, Lucan; Statius he regards as a &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; converted
by Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Fourth Eclogue</i>. His standard authors in Latin
prose are Cicero, Livy, Pliny, Frontinus and Orosius. His
knowledge of Greek was practically nil. Latin was the language
of his political treatise, <i>De Monarchia</i>, and even that of his
defence of the vulgar tongue, <i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i>. He is, in a
limited sense, a precursor of the Renaissance, but he is far more
truly to be regarded as the crowning representative of the
spirit of the middle ages.</p>

<p>(iv.) <i>The Modern Age.</i>&mdash;(a) Our fourth period is ushered
in by the age of the Revival of Learning in Italy (c. 1350-1527).
Petrarch (1304-1374) has been well described as
&ldquo;the first of modern men.&rdquo; In contrast with the
<span class="sidenote">Italy.</span>
Schoolmen of the middle ages, he has no partiality for Aristotle.
He was interested in Greek, and, a full century before the fall
of Constantinople, he was in possession of MSS. of Homer and
Plato, though his knowledge of the language was limited to the
barest rudiments. For that knowledge, scanty as it was, he was
indebted to Leontius Pilatus, with whose aid Boccaccio (1313-1375)
became &ldquo;the first of modern men&rdquo; to study Greek to some
purpose during the three years that Leontius spent as his guest
in Florence (1360-1363). It was also at Florence that Greek
was taught in the next generation by Chrysoloras (in 1396-1400).
Another generation passed, and the scholars of the East and
West met at the council of Florence (1439). One of the envoys
of the Greeks, Gemistus Pletho, then inspired Cosimo dei
Medici with the thought of founding an academy for the study
of Plato. The academy was founded, and, in the age of Lorenzo,
Plato and Plotinus were translated into Latin by Marsilio Ficino
(d. 1499). The <i>Apology</i> and <i>Crito</i>, the <i>Phaedo, Phaedrus</i>
and <i>Gorgias</i> of Plato, as well as speeches of Demosthenes and
Aeschines, with the <i>Oeconomics, Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i> of
Aristotle, had already been translated by Leonardo Bruni (d. 1444); the
<i>Rhetoric</i> by Filelfo (1430), and Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i> by
Decembrio (1439). A comprehensive scheme for translating the principal
Greek prose authors into Latin was carried out at Rome by the
founder of the manuscript collections of the Vatican, Nicholas V.
(1447-1455), who had belonged to the literary circle of Cosimo
at Florence. The translation of Aristotle was entrusted to
three of the learned Greeks who had already arrived in Italy,
Trapezuntius, Gaza and Bessarion, while other authors were
undertaken by Italian scholars such as Guarino, Valla, Decembrio
and Perotti. Among the scholars of Italian birth, probably the
only one in this age who rivalled the Greeks as a public expositor
of their own literature was Politian (1454-1494), who lectured
on Homer and Aristotle in Florence, translated Herodian, and
was specially interested in the Latin authors of the Silver Age
and in the text of the <i>Pandects</i> of Justinian. It will be observed
that the study of Greek had been resumed in Florence half a
century before the fall of Constantinople, and that the principal
writers of Greek prose had been translated into Latin before that event.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the quest of MSS. of the Latin classics had been
actively pursued. Petrarch had discovered Cicero&rsquo;s Speech <i>pro Archia</i>
at Liége (1333) and the <i>Letters to Atticus</i> and <i>Quintus</i>
at Verona (1345). Boccaccio had discovered Martial and Ausonius,
and had been the first of the humanists to be familiar with Varro
and Tacitus, while Salutati had recovered Cicero&rsquo;s letters <i>Ad
Familiares</i> (1389). During the council of Constance, Poggio, the
papal secretary, spent in the quest of MSS. the interval between
May 1415 and November 1417, during which he was left at
leisure by the vacancy in the apostolic see.</p>

<p>Thirteen of Cicero&rsquo;s speeches were found by him at Cluny and
Langres, and elsewhere in France or Germany; the commentary
of Asconius, a complete Quintilian, and a large part of Valerius
Flaccus were discovered at St Gallen. A second expedition to
that monastery and to others in the neighbourhood led to the
recovery of Lucretius, Manilius, Silius Italicus and Ammianus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
Marcellinus, while the <i>Silvae</i> of Statius were recovered shortly
afterwards. A complete MS. of Cicero, <i>De Oratore</i>, <i>Brutus</i> and
<i>Orator</i>, was found by Bishop Landriani at Lodi (1421). Cornelius
Nepos was discovered by Traversari in Padua (1434). The
<i>Agricola</i>, <i>Germania</i> and <i>Dialogue</i> of Tacitus reached Italy from
Germany in 1455, and the early books of the <i>Annals</i> in 1508.
Pliny&rsquo;s <i>Panegyric</i> was discovered by Aurispa at Mainz (1433),
and his correspondence with Trajan by Fra Giocondo in Paris
about 1500.</p>

<p>Greek MSS. were brought from the East by Aurispa, who in
1423 returned with no less than two hundred and thirty-eight,
including the celebrated Laurentian MS. of Aeschylus, Sophocles
and Apollonius Rhodius. A smaller number was brought from
Constantinople by Filelfo (1427), while Quintus Smyrnaeus was
discovered in south Italy by Bessarion, who presented his own
collection of MSS. to the republic of Venice and thus led to the
foundation of the library of St Mark&rsquo;s (1468). As the emissary of
Lorenzo, Janus Lascaris paid two visits to the East, returning
from his second visit in 1492 with two hundred MSS. from
Mount Athos.</p>

<p>The Renaissance theory of a humanistic education is illustrated
by several treatises still extant. In 1392 Vergerio
addressed to a prince of Padua the first treatise which methodically
maintains the claims of Latin as an essential part of a
liberal education. Eight years later, he was learning Greek from
Chrysoloras. Among the most distinguished pupils of the latter
was Leonardo Bruni, who, about 1405, wrote &ldquo;the earliest
humanistic tract on education expressly addressed to a lady.&rdquo;
He here urges that the foundation of all true learning is a &ldquo;sound
and thorough knowledge of Latin,&rdquo; and draws up a course of
reading, in which history is represented by Livy, Sallust, Curtius,
and Caesar; oratory by Cicero; and poetry by Virgil. The same
year saw the birth of Maffeo Vegio, whose early reverence for the
muse of Virgil and whose later devotion to the memory of
Monica have left their mark on the educational treatise which he
wrote a few years before his death in 1458. The authors he
recommends include &ldquo;Aesop&rdquo; and Sallust, the tragedies of
Seneca and the epic poets, especially Virgil, whom he interprets in
an allegorical sense. He is in favour of an early simultaneous
study of a wide variety of subjects, to be followed later by the
special study of one or two. Eight years before the death of
Vegio, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pius II.) had composed a
brief treatise on education in the form of a letter to Ladislaus, the
young king of Bohemia and Hungary. The Latin poets to be
studied include Virgil, Lucan, Statius, Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, and
(with certain limitations) Horace, Juvenal and Persius, as well as
Plautus, Terence and the tragedies of Seneca; the prose authors
recommended are Cicero, Livy and Sallust. The first great
school of the Renaissance was that established by Vittorino da
Feltre at Mantua, where he resided for the last twenty-two years
of his life (1424-1446). Among the Latin authors studied were
Virgil and Lucan, with selections from Horace, Ovid and Juvenal,
besides Cicero and Quintilian, Sallust and Curtius, Caesar and
Livy. The Greek authors were Homer, Hesiod, Pindar and the
dramatists, with Herodotus, Xenophon and Plato, Isocrates and
Demosthenes, Plutarch and Arrian.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Guarino had been devoting five years to the training
of the eldest son of the marquis of Ferrara. At Ferrara he spent
the last thirty years of his long life (1370-1460), producing text-books
of Greek and Latin grammar, and translations from
Strabo and Plutarch. His method may be gathered from his
son&rsquo;s treatise, <i>De Ordine Docendi et Studendi</i>. In that treatise
the essential marks of an educated person are, not only ability to
write Latin verse, but also, a point of &ldquo;at least equal importance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;familiarity with the language and literature of Greece.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Without a knowledge of Greek, Latin scholarship itself is, in
any real sense, impossible&rdquo; (1459).</p>

<p>By the fall of Constantinople in 1453, &ldquo;Italy (in the eloquent
phrase of Carducci) became sole heir and guardian of the ancient
civilization,&rdquo; but its fall was in no way necessary for the revival
of learning, which had begun a century before. Bessarion,
Theodorus Gaza, Georgius Trepezuntius, Argyropulus, Chalcondyles,
all had reached Italy before 1453. A few more Greeks
fled to Italy after that date, and among these were Janus
Lascaris, Musurus and Callierges. All three were of signal service
in devoting their knowledge of Greek to perpetuating and
popularizing the Greek classics with the aid of the newly-invented
art of printing. That art had been introduced into
Italy by the German printers, Sweynheym and Pannartz, who
had worked under Fust at Mainz. At Subiaco and at Rome they
had produced in 1465-1471 the earliest editions of Cicero, <i>De
Oratore</i> and the <i>Letters</i>, and eight other Latin authors.</p>

<p>The printing of Greek began at Milan with the Greek grammar
of Constantine Lascaris (1476). At Florence the earliest editions
of Homer (1488) and Isocrates (1493) had been produced by
Demetrius Chalcondyles, while Janus Lascaris was the first to
edit the Greek anthology, Apollonius Rhodius, and parts of
Euripides, Callimachus and Lucian (1494-1496). In 1494-1515
Aldus Manutius published at Venice no less than twenty-seven
<i>editiones principes</i> of Greek authors and of Greek works of
reference, the authors including Aristotle, Theophrastus,
Theocritus, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Sophocles, Herodotus,
Euripides, Demosthenes (and the minor Attic orators), Pindar,
Plato and Athenaeus. In producing Plato, Athenaeus and
Aristophanes, the scholar-printer was largely aided by Musurus,
who also edited the Aldine Pausanias (1516) and the <i>Etymologicum</i>
printed in Venice by another Greek immigrant,
Callierges (1499).</p>

<p>The Revival of Learning in Italy ends with the sack of Rome
(1527). Before 1525 the study of Greek had begun to decline in
Italy, but meanwhile an interest in that language had been
transmitted to the lands beyond the Alps.</p>

<p>In the study of Latin the principal aim of the Italian humanists
was the <i>imitation</i> of the style of their classical models. In the
case of poetry, this imitative spirit is apparent in Petrarch&rsquo;s
<i>Africa</i>, and in the Latin poems of Politian, Pontano, Sannazaro,
Vida and many others. Petrarch was not only the imitator
of Virgil, who had been the leading name in Latin letters throughout
the middle ages; it was the influence of Petrarch that gave
a new prominence to Cicero. The imitation of Cicero was carried
on with varying degrees of success by humanists such as Gasparino
da Barzizza (d. 1431), who introduced a new style of
epistolary Latin; by Paolo Cortesi, who discovered the importance
of a rhythmical structure in the composition of Ciceronian
prose (1490); and by the accomplished secretaries of Leo X.,
Bembo and Sadoleto. Both of these papal secretaries were
mentioned in complimentary terms by Erasmus in his celebrated
dialogue, the <i>Ciceronianus</i> (1528), in which no less than one
hundred and six Ciceronian scholars of all nations are briefly
and brilliantly reviewed, the slavish imitation of Cicero denounced,
and the law laid down that &ldquo;to speak with propriety
we must adapt ourselves to the age in which we live&mdash;an age
that differs entirely from that of Cicero.&rdquo; One of the younger
Ciceronians criticized by Erasmus was Longolius, who had
died at Padua in 1522. The cause of the Ciceronians was defended
by the elder Scaliger in 1531 and 1536, and by Étienne
Dolet in 1535, and the controversy was continued by other
scholars down to the year 1610. Meanwhile, in Italy, a strict
type of Ciceronianism was represented by Paulus Manutius
(d. 1574), and a freer and more original form of Latinity by
Muretus (d. 1585).</p>

<p>Before touching on the salient points in the subsequent
centuries, in connexion with the leading nations of Europe,
we may briefly note the cosmopolitan position of Erasmus
(1466-1536), who, although he was a native of the Netherlands,
was far more closely connected with France, England, Italy,
Germany and Switzerland, than with the land of his birth.
He was still a school-boy at Deventer when his high promise
was recognized by Rudolf Agricola, &ldquo;the first (says Erasmus)
who brought from Italy some breath of a better culture.&rdquo; Late
in 1499 Erasmus spent some two months at Oxford, where he
met Colet; it was in London that he met More and Linacre and
Grocyn, who had already ceased to lecture at Oxford. At Paris,
in 1500, he was fully conscious that &ldquo;without Greek the amplest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
knowledge of Latin was imperfect&rdquo;; and, during his three
years in Italy (1506-1509), he worked quietly at Greek in Bologna
and attended the lectures of Musurus in Padua. In October
1511 he was teaching Greek to a little band of students in Cambridge;
at Basel in 1516 he produced his edition of the Greek
Testament, the first that was actually published; and during
the next few years he was helping to organize the college lately
founded at Louvain for the study of Greek and Hebrew, as well
as Latin. Seven years at Basel were followed by five at Freiburg,
and by two more at Basel, where he died. The names of all
these places are suggestive of the wide range of his influence.
By his published works, his <i>Colloquies</i>, his <i>Adages</i> and his
<i>Apophthegms</i>, he was the educator of the nations of Europe.
An educational aim is also apparent in his editions of Terence
and of Seneca, while his Latin translations made his contemporaries
more familiar with Greek poetry and prose, and his
<i>Paraphrase</i> promoted a better understanding of the Greek
Testament. He was not so much a scientific scholar as a keen
and brilliant man of letters and a widely influential apostle of
humanism.</p>

<p>In France the most effective of the early teachers of Greek
was Janus Lascaris (1495-1503). Among his occasional pupils
was Budaeus (d. 1540), who prompted Francis I.
<span class="sidenote">France.</span>
to found in 1530 the corporation of the Royal Readers
in Greek, as well as Latin and Hebrew, afterwards famous
under the name of the Collège de France. In the study of
Greek one of the earliest links between Italy and Germany
was Rudolf Agricola, who had learned Greek under
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
Gaza at Ferrara. It was in Paris that his younger contemporary
Reuchlin acquired part of that proficiency in Greek
which attracted the notice of Argyropulus, whose admiration
of Reuchlin is twice recorded by Melanchthon, who soon afterwards
was pre-eminent as the &ldquo;praeceptor&rdquo; of Germany.</p>

<p>In the age of the revival the first Englishman who studied
Greek was a Benedictine monk, William of Selling (d. 1494),
who paid two visits to Italy. At Canterbury he
inspired with his own love of learning his nephew,
<span class="sidenote">England.</span>
Linacre, who joined him on one of those visits, studied Greek
at Florence under Politian and Chalcondyles, and apparently
stayed in Italy from 1485 to 1499. His translation of a treatise
of Galen was printed at Cambridge in 1521 by Siberch, who,
in the same year and place, was the first to use Greek type in
England. Greek had been first taught to some purpose at
Oxford by Grocyn on his return from Italy in 1491. One of the
younger scholars of the day was William Lilye, who picked up
his Greek at Rhodes on his way to Palestine and became the
first high-master of the school founded by Colet at St Paul&rsquo;s
(1510).</p>

<p>(b) That part of the <i>Modern Period</i> of classical studies which
succeeds the age of the Revival in Italy may be subdivided
into three periods distinguished by the names of the nations
most prominent in each.</p>

<p>1. The first may be designated the <i>French</i> period. It begins
with the foundation of the Royal Readers by Francis I. in 1530,
and it may perhaps be regarded as extending to 1700.
This period is marked by a many-sided <i>erudition</i>
<span class="sidenote">The French period.</span>
rather than by any special cult of the <i>form</i> of the
classical languages. It is the period of the great polyhistors of
France. It includes Budaeus and the elder Scaliger (who
settled in France in 1529), with Turnebus and Lambinus, and
the learned printers Robertus and Henricus Stephanus, while
among its foremost names are those of the younger (and greater)
Scaliger, Casaubon and Salmasius. Of these, Casaubon ended
his days in England (1614); Scaliger, by leaving France for the
Netherlands in 1593, for a time at least transferred the supremacy
in scholarship from the land of his birth to that of his adoption.
The last sixteen years of his life (1593-1609) were spent at Leiden,
which was also for more than twenty years (1631-1653) the
home of Salmasius, and for thirteen (1579-1592) that of Lipsius
(d. 1606). In the 17th century the erudition of France is best
represented by &ldquo;Henricus Valesius,&rdquo; Du Cange and Mabillon.
In the same period Italy was represented by Muretus, who
had left France in 1563, and by her own sons, Nizolius, Victorius,
Robortelli and Sigonius, followed in the 17th century by R.
Fabretti. The Netherlands, in the 16th, claim W. Canter as
well as Lipsius, and, in the 17th, G.J. Vossius, Johannes Meursius,
the elder and younger Heinsius, Hugo Grotius, J.F.
Gronovius, J.G. Graevius and J. Perizonius. Scotland, in the
16th, is represented by George Buchanan; England by Sir John
Cheke, Roger Ascham, and Sir Henry Savile, and, in the 17th,
by Thomas Gataker, Thomas Stanley, Henry Dodwell, and
Joshua Barnes; Germany by Janus Gruter, Ezechiel Spanheim
and Chr. Cellarius, the first two of whom were also connected
with other countries.</p>

<p>We have already seen that a strict imitation of Cicero was
one of the characteristics of the Italian humanists. In and
after the middle of the 16th century a correct and
pure Latinity was promoted by the educational
<span class="sidenote">Literary Latin.</span>
system of the Jesuits; but with the growth of the
vernacular literatures Latin became more and more exclusively
the language of the learned. Among the most conspicuous
Latin writers of the 17th century are G.J. Vossius and the
Heinsii, with Salmasius and his great adversary, Milton. Latin
was also used in works on science and philosophy, such as Sir
Isaac Newton&rsquo;s <i>Principia</i> (1687), and many of the works of
Leibnitz (1646-1705). In botany the custom followed by John
Ray (1627-1705) in his <i>Historia Plantarum</i> and in other works
was continued in 1760 by Linnaeus in his <i>Systema Naturae</i>.
The last important work in English theology written in Latin
was George Bull&rsquo;s <i>Defensio Fidei Nicenae</i> (1685). The use of
Latin in diplomacy died out towards the end of the 17th century;
but, long after that date negotiations with the German empire
were conducted in Latin, and Latin was the language of the
debates in the Hungarian diet down to 1825.</p>

<p>2. During the 18th century the classical scholarship of the
Netherlands was under the healthy and stimulating influence
of Bentley (1662-1742), who marks the beginning
of the English and Dutch period, mainly represented
<span class="sidenote">The English and Dutch period.</span>
in Holland by Bentley&rsquo;s younger contemporary and
correspondent, Tiberius Hemsterhuys (1685-1766),
and the latter scholar&rsquo;s great pupil David Ruhnken (1723-1798).
It is the age of historical and literary, as well as verbal, criticism.
Both of these were ably represented in the first half of the
century by Bentley himself, while, in the twenty years between
1782 and 1803, the verbal criticism of the tragic poets of Athens
was the peculiar province of Richard Porson (1759-1808), who
was born in the same year as F.A. Wolf. Among other representatives
of England were Jeremiah Markland and Jonathan
Toup, Thomas Tyrwhitt and Thomas Twining, Samuel Parr
and Sir William Jones; and of the Netherlands, the two Burmanns
and L. Küster, Arnold Drakenborch and Wesseling,
Lodewyk Valckenaer and Daniel Wyttenbach (1746-1829).
Germany is represented by Fabricius and J.M. Gesner, J.A.
Ernesti and J.J. Reiske, J.J. Winckelmann and Chr. G. Heyne;
France by B. de Montfaucon and J.B.G.D. Villoison; Alsace
by French subjects of German origin, R.F.P. Brunck and J.
Schweighäuser; and Italy by E. Forcellini and Ed. Corsini.</p>

<p>3. The <i>German</i> period begins with F.A. Wolf (1759-1824),
whose <i>Prolegomena</i> to Homer appeared in 1795. He is the
founder of the systematic and encyclopaedic type
of scholarship embodied in the comprehensive term
<span class="sidenote">The German period.</span>
<i>Altertumswissenschaft</i>, or &ldquo;a scientific knowledge
of the old classical world.&rdquo; The tradition of Wolf
was ably continued by August Böckh (d. 1867), one of the
leaders of the historical and antiquarian school, brilliantly
represented in the previous generation by B.G. Niebuhr (d.
1831).</p>

<p>In contrast with this school we have the critical and grammatical
school of Gottfried Hermann (d. 1848). During this
period, while Germany remains the most productive of the
nations, scholarship has been more and more international
and cosmopolitan in its character.</p>

C. Thirlwall, T. Arnold, G. Long and Charles Merivale, Sir
Henry Maine, Sir Charles Newton and A.S. Murray, Robert
Burn and H.F. Pelham. Among comparative philologists
Max Müller belonged to Germany by birth and to England by
adoption, while, in the United States, his ablest counterpart
was W.D. Whitney. B.L. Gildersleeve, W.W. Goodwin, Henry
Drisler, J.B. Greenough and G.M. Lane were prominent
American classical scholars.</p>

<p>The 19th century in Germany was marked by the organization
of the great series of Greek and Latin inscriptions, and by
the foundation of the Archaeological Institute in Rome (1829),
which was at first international in its character. The Athenian
Institute was founded in 1874. Schools at Athens and Rome
were founded by France in 1846 and 1873, by the United States
of America in 1882 and 1895, and by England in 1883 and 1901;
<span class="sidenote">Schools of Rome and Athens.</span>
and periodicals are published by the schools of all these
four nations. An interest in Greek studies (and especially
in art and archaeology) has been maintained in
England by the Hellenic Society, founded in 1879, with
its organ the <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>. A further interest in
Greek archaeology has been awakened in all civilized lands by
the excavations of Troy, Mycenae, Tiryns, Epidaurus, Sparta,
Olympia, Dodona, Delphi, Delos and of important sites in Crete.
The extensive discoveries of papyri in Egypt have greatly
extended our knowledge of the administration of that country in
the times of the Ptolemies, and have materially added to the
existing remains of Greek literature. Scholars have been
enabled to realize in their own experience some of the enthusiasm
that attended the recovery of lost classics during the Revival of
Learning. They have found themselves living in a new age of
<i>editiones principes</i>, and have eagerly welcomed the first publication
of Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Constitution of Athens</i> (1891), Herondas (1891)
and Bacchylides (1897), as well as the <i>Persae</i> of Timotheus of
Miletus (1903), with some of the <i>Paeans</i> of Pindar (1907) and
large portions of the plays of Menander (1898-1899 and 1907).
The first four of these were first edited by F.G. Kenyon,
Timotheus by von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff, Menander partly by
J. Nicole and G. Lefebre and partly by B.P. Grenfell and A.S.
Hunt, who have also produced fragments of the <i>Paeans</i> of
Pindar and many other classic texts (including a Greek continuation
of Thucydides and a Latin epitome of part of Livy) in
the successive volumes of the <i>Oxyrhynchus papyri</i> and other
kindred publications.</p>

<p class="center1 sc">(B) The Study of the Classics in Secondary Education</p>

<p>After the Revival of Learning the study of the classics owed
much to the influence and example of Vittorino da Feltre,
Budacus, Erasmus and Melanchthon, who were among the
leading representatives of that revival in Italy, France, England
and Germany.</p>

<p>1. In <i>England</i>, the two great schools of Winchester (1382) and
Eton (1440) had been founded during the life of Vittorino, but
before the revival had reached Britain. The first
school<a name="FnAnchor_2l" id="FnAnchor_2l" href="#Footnote_2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> which came into being under the immediate
<span class="sidenote">England.</span>
influence of humanism was that founded at St Paul&rsquo;s by Dean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span>
Colet (1510), the friend of Erasmus, whose treatise <i>De pueris
instituendis</i> (1529) has its English counterpart in the <i>Governor</i> of
Sir Thomas Elyot (1531). The highmaster of St Paul&rsquo;s was to be
&ldquo;learned in good and clean Latin, and also in Greek, if such may
be gotten.&rdquo; The master and the second master of Shrewsbury
(founded 1551) were to be &ldquo;well able to make a Latin verse, and
learned in the Greek tongue.&rdquo; The influence of the revival
extended to many other schools, such as Christ&rsquo;s Hospital (1552),
Westminster (1560), and Merchant Taylors&rsquo; (1561); Repton
(1557), Rugby (1567) and Harrow (1571).</p>

<p>At the grammar school of Stratford-on-Avon, about 1571-1577,
Shakespeare presumably studied Terence, Horace, Ovid
and the <i>Bucolics</i> of Baptista Mantuanus (1502). In
the early plays he quotes Ovid and Seneca. Similarly,
<span class="sidenote">Shakespeare and the grammar-school.</span>
in <i>Titus Andronicus</i> (iv. 2) he says, of <i>Integer vitae</i>:
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a verse in Horace; I know it well: I read it in
the grammar long ago.&rdquo; In <i>Henry VI.</i> part ii. sc. 7,
when Jack Cade charges Lord Say with having &ldquo;most
traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
grammar-school,&rdquo; Lord Say replies that &ldquo;ignorance is the curse
of God, knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.&rdquo; In
the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> (I. i. 157) a line is quoted as from
Terence (<i>Andria</i>, 74): &ldquo;<i>redime te captum quam queas minimo.</i>&rdquo;
This is taken <i>verbatim</i> from Lilye&rsquo;s contribution to the <i>Brevis
Institutio</i>, originally composed by Colet, Erasmus and Lilye for
<span class="sidenote">Early text-books.</span>
St Paul&rsquo;s School (1527), and ultimately adopted as the
<i>Eton Latin Grammar</i>. The <i>Westminster Greek Grammar</i>
of Grant (1575) was succeeded by that of Camden
(1595), founded mainly on a Paduan text-book, and apparently
adopted in 1596 by Sir Henry Savile at Eton, where it long
remained in use as the <i>Eton Greek Grammar</i>, while at Westminster
itself it was superseded by that of Busby (1663). The
text-books to be used at Harrow in 1590 included Hesiod and
some of the Greek orators and historians.</p>

<p>In one of the <i>Paston Letters</i> (i. 301), an Eton boy of 1468 quotes
two Latin verses of his own composition. Nearly a century later,
on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1560, forty-four boys of the school
presented Latin verses to Queen Elizabeth. The queen&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Ascham.</span>
former tutor, Roger Ascham, in his <i>Scholemaster</i> (1570), agrees
with his Strassburg friend, J. Sturm, in making the imitation of
the Latin classics the main aim of instruction. He is more
original when he insists on the value of translation and retranslation
for acquiring a mastery over Latin prose composition, and
when he protests against compelling boys to converse in Latin
too soon. Ascham&rsquo;s influence is apparent in the <i>Positions</i> of
Mulcaster, who in 1581 insists on instruction in English before
admission to a grammar-school, while he is distinctly in advance
of his age in urging the foundation of a special college for the
training of teachers.</p>

<p>Cleland&rsquo;s <i>Institution of a Young Nobleman</i> (1607) owes much to
the Italian humanists. The author follows Ascham in protesting
against compulsory Latin conversation, and only
slightly modifies his predecessor&rsquo;s method of teaching
<span class="sidenote">Cleland.</span>
Latin prose. When Latin grammar has been mastered, he
bids the teacher lead his pupil &ldquo;into the sweet fountain and
spring of all Arts and Science,&rdquo; that is, Greek learning which is
&ldquo;as profitable for the understanding as the Latin tongue for
speaking.&rdquo; In the study of ancient history, &ldquo;deeds and not
words&rdquo; are the prime interest. &ldquo;In Plutarch pleasure is so
mixed and confounded with profit; that I esteem the reading of
him as a paradise for a curious spirit to walk in at all time.&rdquo;
Bacon in his <i>Advancement of Learning</i> (1605) notes it as &ldquo;the first
distemper of learning when men study words and not matter&rdquo;
(I. iv. 3); he also observes that the Jesuits &ldquo;have much
<span class="sidenote">Bacon, Milton, Petty.</span>
quickened and strengthened the state of learning&rdquo;
(I. vi. 15). He is on the side of reform in education;
he waves the humanist aside with the words: <i>vetustas
cessit, ratio vicit</i>. Milton, in his <i>Tractate on Education</i>
(1644), advances further on Bacon&rsquo;s lines, protesting against the
length of time spent on instruction in language, denouncing
merely verbal knowledge, and recommending the study of a
large number of classical authors for the sake of their subject-matter,
and with a view to their bearing on practical life. His
ideal place of education is an institution combining a school and
a university. Sir William Petty, the economist (1623-1687),
urged the establishment of <i>ergastula literaria</i> for instruction of a
purely practical kind. Locke, who had been educated
<span class="sidenote">Locke.</span>
at Winchester and had lectured on Greek at Oxford
(1660), nevertheless almost completely eliminated Greek from
the scheme which he unfolded in his <i>Thoughts on Education</i>
(1693). With Locke, the moral and practical qualities of virtue
and prudence are of the first consideration. Instruction, he
declares, is but the least part of education; his aim is to train,
not men of letters or men of science, but practical men armed for
the battle of life. Latin was, above all, to be learned through use,
with as little grammar as possible, but with the reading of easy
Latin texts, and with no repetition, no composition. Greek he
absolutely proscribes, reserving a knowledge of that language to
the learned and the lettered, and to professional scholars.</p>

<p>Throughout the 18th century and the early part of the 19th,
the old routine went on in England with little variety, and with
no sign of expansion. The range of studies was
widened, however, at Rugby in 1828-1842 by Thomas
<span class="sidenote">Arnold.</span>
Arnold, whose interest in ancient history and geography, as a
necessary part of classical learning, is attested by his edition of
Thucydides; while his influence was still further extended when
those who had been trained in his traditions became head masters
of other schools.</p>

<p>During the rest of the century the leading landmarks are the
three royal commissions known by the names of their chairmen:
(1) Lord Clarendon&rsquo;s on nine public schools, Eton, Winchester,
Westminster, Charterhouse, Harrow, Rugby, Shrewsbury, St
Paul&rsquo;s and Merchant Taylors&rsquo; (1861-1864), resulting in the
Public Schools Act of 1868; (2) Lord Taunton&rsquo;s on 782 endowed
schools (1864-1867), followed by the act of 1869; and (3) Mr
Bryce&rsquo;s on secondary education (1894-1895).</p>

<p>A certain discontent with the current traditions of classical
training found expression in the <i>Essays on a Liberal Education</i>
(1867). The author of the first essay, C.S. Parker,
closed his review of the reforms instituted in Germany
<span class="sidenote">Controversy on classical education.</span>
and France by adding that in England there had
been but little change. The same volume included a
critical examination of the &ldquo;Theory of Classical Education&rdquo; by
Henry Sidgwick, and an attack on compulsory Greek and Latin
verse composition by F.W. Farrar. The claims of verse composition
have since been judiciously defended by the Hon.
Edward Lyttelton (1897), while a temperate and effective
restatement of the case for the classics may be found in Sir
Richard Jebb&rsquo;s Romanes Lecture on &ldquo;Humanism in Education&rdquo;
(1899).</p>

<p>The question of the position of Greek in secondary education
has from time to time attracted attention in connexion with the
requirement of Greek in Responsions at Oxford, and in the
Previous Examination at Cambridge.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cambridge University Reporter</i> for November 9, 1870, it
was stated that, &ldquo;in order to provide adequate encouragement
for the study of Modern Languages and Natural
Science,&rdquo; the commissioners for endowed schools had
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Compulsory Greek.&rdquo;</span>
determined on the establishment of modern schools of
the first grade in which Greek would be excluded. The
commissioners feared that, so long as Greek was a <i>sine qua non</i>
at the universities, these schools would be cut off from direct
connexion with the universities, while the universities would in
some degree lose their control over a portion of the higher
culture of the nation. On the 9th of March 1871 a syndicate
recommended that, in the Previous Examination, French and
German (taken together) should be allowed in place of Greek;
on the 27th of April this recommendation (which only affected
candidates for honours or for medical degrees) was rejected by
51 votes to 48.</p>

<p>All the other proposals and votes relating to Greek in the
Previous Examination in 1870-1873, 1878-1880, and 1891-1892
are set forth in the <i>Cambridge University Reporter</i> for November
11, 1904, pp. 202-205. In November 1903 a syndicate was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>
appointed to consider the studies and examinations of the university,
their report of November 1904 on the Previous Examination
was fully discussed, and the speeches published in the
<i>Reporter</i> fcr December 17, 1904. In the course of the discussion
Sir Richard Jebb drew attention to the statistics collected by the
master of Emmanuel, Mr W. Chawner, showing that, out of 86
head masters belonging to the Head Masters&rsquo; Conference whose
replies had been published, &ldquo;about 56 held the opinion that the
exemption from Greek for all candidates for a degree would
endanger or altogether extinguish the study of Greek in the vast
majority of schools, while about 21 head masters held a different
opinion.&rdquo; On the 3rd of March 1905 a proposal for accepting
either French or German as an alternative for either Latin or
Greek in the Previous Examination was rejected by 1559 to 1052
votes, and on the 26th of May 1906 proposals distinguishing
between students in letters and students in science, and (<i>inter
alia</i>) <i>requiring</i> the latter to take either French or German for
either Latin or Greek in the Previous Examination, were rejected
by 746 to 241.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at Oxford a proposal practically making Greek
optional with all undergraduates was rejected, in November 1902,
by 189 votes to 166; a preliminary proposal permitting students
of mathematics or natural science to offer one or more modern
languages in lieu of Greek was passed by 164 to 162 in February
1904, but on the 29th of November the draft of a statute to this
effect was thrown out by 200 to 164. In the course of the
controversy three presidents of the Royal Society, Lord Kelvin,
Lord Lister and Sir W. Huggins, expressed the opinion that the
proposed exemption was not beneficial to science students.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the question of &ldquo;compulsory Greek&rdquo; has
stimulated a desire for greater efficiency in classical teaching. In
December 1903, a year before the most important of
the public discussions at Cambridge, the Classical
<span class="sidenote">The Classical Association.</span>
Association was founded in London. The aim of that
association is &ldquo;to promote the development, and
maintain the well-being, of classical studies, and in particular (a)
to impress upon public opinion the claim of such studies to an
eminent place in the national scheme of education; (b) to
improve the practice of classical teaching by free discussion of its
scope and methods; (c) to encourage investigation and call
attention to new discoveries; (d) to create opportunities of
friendly intercourse and co-operation between all lovers of
classical learning in this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question of the curriculum and the time-table in secondary
education has occupied the attention of the Classical Association,
the British Association and the Education Department
of Scotland. The general effect of the recommendations
<span class="sidenote">The curriculum.</span>
already made would be to begin the study of
foreign languages with French, and to postpone the study of
Latin to the age of twelve and that of Greek to the age of thirteen.
At the Head Masters&rsquo; Conference of December 1907 a proposal to
lower the standard of Greek in the entrance scholarship examinations
of public schools was lost by 10 votes to 16, and the &ldquo;British
Association report&rdquo; was adopted with reservations in 1908.
In the case of secondary schools in receipt of grants of public
money (about 700 in England and 100 in Wales in 1907-1908),
&ldquo;the curriculum, and time-table must be approved by the Board
of Education.&rdquo; The Board has also a certain control over the
curriculum of schools under the Endowed Schools Acts and the
Charitable Trusts Acts, and also over that of schools voluntarily
applying for inspection with a view to being recognized as
efficient.</p>

<p>Further efficiency in classical education has been the aim of the
movement in favour of the reform of Latin pronunciation. In
1871 this movement resulted in Munro and Palmer&rsquo;s
<i>Syllabus of Latin Pronunciation</i>. The reform was
<span class="sidenote">Reform in Latin pronunciation.</span>
carried forward at University College, London, by
Professor Key and by Professor Robinson Ellis in 1873,
and was accepted at Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Liverpool
College, Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, Dulwich, and the City of London
school. It was taken up anew by the Cambridge Philological
Society in 1886, by the Modern Languages Association in 1901, by
the Classical Association in 1904-1905, and the Philological
Societies of Oxford and Cambridge in 1906. The reform was
accepted by the various bodies of head masters and assistant
masters in December 1906-January 1907, and the proposed
scheme was formally approved by the Board of Education in
February 1907.</p>

<p>2. In <i>France</i> it was mainly with a view to promoting the
study of Greek that the corporation of Royal Readers was
founded by Francis I. in 1530 at the prompting of
Budaeus. In the university of Paris, which was
<span class="sidenote">France.</span>
originally opposed to this innovation, the statutes of 1598
prescribed the study of Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Theocritus,
Plato, Demosthenes and Isocrates (as well as the principal Latin
classics), and required the production of three exercises in Greek
or Latin in each week.</p>

<p>From the middle of the 16th century the elements of Latin
were generally learned from unattractive abridgments of the
grammar of the Flemish scholar, van Pauteren or
Despautère (d. 1520), which, in its original folio
<span class="sidenote">Textbooks.</span>
editions of 1537-1538, was an excellent work. The
unhappy lot of those who were compelled to learn their Latin
from the current abridgments was lamented by a Port-Royalist
in a striking passage describing the gloomy forest of <i>le pays de
Despautère</i> (Guyot, quoted in Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s <i>Port-Royal</i>, iii. 429).
The first Latin grammar written in French was that of Père de
Condren of the <i>Oratoire</i> (c. 1642), which was followed by the
Port-Royal <i>Méthode latine</i> of Claude Lancelot (1644), and by
the grammar composed by Bossuet for the dauphin, and also
used by Fénelon for the instruction of the duc de Bourgogne.
In the second half of the 17th century the rules of grammar
and rhetoric were simplified, and the time withdrawn from the
practice of composition (especially verse composition) transferred
to the explanation and the study of authors.</p>

<p>Richelieu, in 1640, formed a scheme for a college in which
Latin was to have a subordinate place, while room was to be
found for the study of history and science, Greek, and
French and modern languages. Bossuet, in educating
<span class="sidenote">Richelieu, Bossuet, Fénelon, Fleury.</span>
the dauphin, added to the ordinary classical routine
represented by the extensive series of the &ldquo;Delphin
Classics&rdquo; the study of history and of science. A greater originality
in the method of teaching the ancient languages was
exemplified by Fénelon, whose views were partially reflected
by the Abbé Fleury, who also desired the simplification of
grammar, the diminution of composition, and even the suppression
of Latin verse. Of the ordinary teaching of Greek in
his day, Fleury wittily observed that most boys &ldquo;learned just
enough of that language to have a pretext for saying for the rest
of their lives that Greek was a subject easily forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the 18th century Rollin, in his <i>Traité des études</i> (1726),
agreed with the Port-Royalists in demanding that Latin
grammars should be written in French, that the rules
should be simplified and explained by a sufficient
<span class="sidenote">Rollin.</span>
number of examples, and that a more important place should
be assigned to translation than to composition. The supremacy
of Latin was the subject of a long series of attacks in the same
century. Even at the close of the previous century the brilliant
achievements of French literature had prompted La Bruyère
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
to declare in <i>Des ouvrages de l&rsquo;esprit</i> (about 1680), &ldquo;We have at
last thrown off the yoke of <i>Latinism</i>&rdquo;; and, in the same year,
Jacques Spon claimed in his correspondence the right to use the
French language in discussing points of archaeology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1563, notwithstanding the opposition of the
university of Paris, the Jesuits had succeeded in founding the
<i>Collegium Claromontanum</i>. After the accession of
Henry IV. they were expelled from Paris and other
<span class="sidenote">The Jesuits.</span>
important towns in 1594, and not allowed to return
until 1609, when they found themselves confronted once more
by their rival, the university of Paris. They opened the doors of
their schools to the Greek and Latin classics, but they represented
the ancient masterpieces dissevered from their original historic
environment, as impersonal models of taste, as isolated standards
of style. They did much, however, for the cultivation of original
composition modelled on Cicero and Virgil. They have been
charged with paying an exaggerated attention to form, and
with neglecting the subject-matter of the classics. This neglect
is attributed to their anxiety to avoid the &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; element in
the ancient literature. Intensely conservative in their methods,
they kept up the system of using Latin in their grammars
(and in their oral instruction) long after it had been abandoned
by others.</p>

<p>The use of French for these purposes was a characteristic of
the &ldquo;Little Schools&rdquo; of the Jansenists of Port-Royal(1643-1660).
The text-books prepared for them by Lancelot included
not only the above-mentioned Latin grammar (1644)
<span class="sidenote">Port-Royal.</span>
but also the <i>Méthode grecque</i> of 1655 and the <i>Jardin
des racines grecques</i> (1657), which remained in use for two centuries
and largely superseded the grammar of Clenardus (1636)
and the <i>Tirocinium</i> of Père Labbe (1648). Greek began to decline
in the university about 1650, at the very time when the Port-Royalists
were aiming at its revival. During the brief existence
of their schools their most celebrated pupils were Tillemont
and Racine.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, on the other hand, claimed Corneille and Molière,
as well as Descartes and Bossuet, Fontenelle, Montesquieu and
Voltaire. Of their Latin poets the best-known were Denis Petau
(d. 1652), René Rapin (d. 1687) and N.E. Sanadon (d. 1733).
In 1762 the Jesuits were suppressed, and more than one hundred
schools were thus deprived of their teachers. The university
of Paris, which had prompted their suppression, and the parliament,
which had carried it into effect, made every endeavour
to replace them. The university took possession of the <i>Collegium
Claromontanum</i>, then known as the <i>Collège Louis-le-Grand</i>,
and transformed it into an <i>école normale</i>. Many of the Jesuit
schools were transferred to the congregations of the <i>Oratoire</i>
and the Benedictines, and to the secular clergy. On the eve of
the Revolution, out of a grand total of 562 classical schools,
384 were in the hands of the clergy and 178 in those of the
congregations.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the Jesuits gave a new impulse to the attacks
directed against all schemes of education in which Latin held
a prominent position. At the moment when the
university of Paris was, by the absence of its rivals,
<span class="sidenote">Classical education attacked.</span>
placed in complete control of the education of France,
she found herself driven to defend the principles of
classical education against a crowd of assailants. All kinds of
devices were suggested for expediting the acquisition of Latin;
grammar was to be set aside; Latin was to be learned as a
&ldquo;living language&rdquo;; much attention was to be devoted to
acquiring an extensive vocabulary; and, &ldquo;to save time,&rdquo;
composition was to be abolished. To facilitate the reading of
Latin texts, the favourite method was the use of interlinear
translations, originally proposed by Locke, first popularized in
France by Dumarsais (1722), and in constant vogue down to the
time of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Early in the 18th century Rollin pleaded for the &ldquo;utility
of Greek,&rdquo; while he described that language as the heritage of
the university of Paris. In 1753 Berthier feared that in thirty
years no one would be able to read Greek. In 1768 Rolland
declared that the university, which held Greek in high honour,
nevertheless had reason to lament that her students learnt little
of the language, and he traced this decline to the fact that attendance
at lectures had ceased to be compulsory. Greek, however,
was still recognized as part of the examination held for the
appointment of schoolmasters.</p>

<p>During the 18th century, in Greek as well as in Latin, the
general aim was to reach the goal as rapidly as possible, even at
the risk of missing it altogether. On the eve of the
Revolution, France was enjoying the study of the
<span class="sidenote">Eve of the Revolution.</span>
institutions of Greece in the attractive pages of the
<i>Voyage du jeune Anacharsis</i> (1789), but the study of
Greek was menaced even more than that of Latin. For fifty
years before the Revolution there was a distinct dissatisfaction
with the routine of the schools. To meet that dissatisfaction,
the teachers had accepted new subjects of study, had improved
their methods, and had simplified the learning of the dead
languages. But even this was not enough. In the study of the
classics, as in other spheres, it was revolution rather than
evolution that was loudly demanded.</p>

<p>The Revolution was soon followed by the long-continued
battle of the &ldquo;Programmes.&rdquo; Under the First Republic the
schemes of Condorcet (April 1792) and J. Lakanal
(February 1795) were superseded by that of P.C.F.
<span class="sidenote">First Republic.</span>
Daunou (October 1795), which divided the pupils of
the &ldquo;central schools&rdquo; into three groups, according to age, with
corresponding subjects of study: (1) twelve to fourteen,&mdash;drawing,
natural history, Greek and Latin, and a choice of modern
languages; (2) fourteen to sixteen,&mdash;mathematics, physics,
chemistry; (3) over sixteen,&mdash;general grammar, literature,
history and constitutional law..</p>

<p>In July 1801, under the consulate, there were two courses, (1)
nine to twelve,&mdash;elementary knowledge, including elements of
Latin; (2) above twelve,&mdash;a higher course, with two
<span class="sidenote">Consulate.</span>
alternatives, &ldquo;humanistic&rdquo; studies for the &ldquo;civil,&rdquo;
and purely practical studies for the &ldquo;military&rdquo; section. The law
of the 1st of May 1802 brought the <i>lycées</i> into existence, the
subjects being, in Napoleon&rsquo;s own phrase, &ldquo;mainly Latin and
mathematics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the Restoration (1814) the military discipline of the lycées
was replaced by the ecclesiastical discipline of the &ldquo;Royal
Colleges.&rdquo; The reaction of 1815-1821 in favour of
classics was followed by the more liberal programme of
<span class="sidenote">Restoration.</span>
Vatimesnil (1829), including, for those who had no
taste for a classical education, certain &ldquo;special courses&rdquo; (1830),
which were the germ of the <i>enseignement spécial</i> and the <i>enseignement
moderne</i>.</p>

<p>Under Louis Philippe (1830-1848), amid all varieties of
administration there was a consistent desire to hold the balance
fairly between all the conflicting subjects of study. After the
revolution of 1848 the difficulties raised by the excessive number
of subjects were solved by H.N.H. Fortoul&rsquo;s expedient of
&ldquo;bifurcation,&rdquo; the alternatives being letters and science. In
1863, under Napoleon III., Victor Duruy encouraged the study of
history, and also did much for classical learning by founding the
École des Hautes Études. In 1872, under the Third Republic,
Jules Simon found time for hygiene, geography and modern
<span class="sidenote">Third Republic.</span>
languages by abolishing Latin verse composition and
reducing the number of exercises in Latin prose, while
he insisted on the importance of studying the inner
meaning of the ancient classics. The same principles were
carried out by Jules Ferry (1880) and Paul Bert (1881-1882). In
the scheme of 1890 the Latin course of six years began with ten
hours a week and ended with four; Greek was begun a year later
with two hours, increasing to six and ending with four.</p>

<p>The commission of 1899, under the able chairmanship of M.
Alexandre Ribot, published an important report, which was
followed in 1902 by the scheme of M. Georges Leygues. The
preamble includes a striking tribute to the advantages that
France had derived from the study of the classics:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;étude de l&rsquo;antiquité grecque et latine a donné au génie français
une mesure, une clarté et une élégance incomparables. C&rsquo;est par

</div>

<p>By the scheme introduced in these memorable terms the
course of seven years is divided into two cycles, the first cycle (of
four years) having two parallel courses: (1) without Greek or
Latin, and (2) with Latin, and with optional Greek at the
beginning of the third year. In the second cycle (of three years)
those who have been learning both Greek and Latin, and those
who have been learning neither, continue on the same lines as
before; while those who have been learning Latin only may
either (1) discontinue it in favour of modern languages <i>and</i>
science, or (2) continue it with <i>either</i>. As an alternative to the
second cycle, which normally ends in the examination for the
<i>baccalauréat</i>, there is a shorter course, mainly founded on
modern languages or applied science and ending in a public
examination without the <i>baccalauréat</i>. The <i>baccalauréat</i>,
however, has been condemned by the next minister, M. Briand, who
prefers to crown the course with the award of a school diploma (1907).</p>

<p>3. The history of education in Germany since 1500 falls into
three periods: (a) the age of the Revival of Learning and the
Reformation (1500-1650), (b) the age of French influence
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
(1650-1800), and (c) the 19th century.</p>

<p>(a) During the first twenty years of the 16th century the
reform of Latin instruction was carried out by setting aside the
old medieval grammars, by introducing new manuals of classical
literature, and by prescribing the study of classical authors and
the imitation of classical models. In all these points the lead was
first taken by south Germany, and by the towns along the Rhine
down to the Netherlands. The old schools and universities were
being quietly interpenetrated by the new spirit of humanism,
when the sky was suddenly darkened by the clouds of religious
conflict. In 1525-1535 there was a marked depression in the
classical studies of Germany. Erasmus, writing to W. Pirckheimer
in 1528, exclaims: &ldquo;Wherever the spirit of Luther
prevails, learning goes to the ground.&rdquo; Such a fate was, however,
averted by the intervention of Melanchthon (d. 1560), the
<span class="sidenote">Melanchthon.</span>
<i>praeceptor Germaniae</i>, who was the embodiment of the
spirit of the new Protestant type of education, with its
union of evangelical doctrine and humanistic culture.
Under his influence, new schools rapidly rose into being at
Magdeburg, Eisleben and Nuremberg (1521-1526). During
more than forty years of academic activity he not only provided
manuals of Latin and Greek grammar and many other text-books
that long remained in use, but he also formed for Germany a
well-trained class of learned teachers, who extended his influence
throughout the land. His principal ally as an educator and as a
writer of text-books was Camerarius (d. 1574). Precepts of style,
and models taken from the best Latin authors, were the means
whereby a remarkable skill in the imitation of Cicero was attained
at Strassburg during the forty-four years of the headmastership of
Johannes von Sturm (d. 1589), who had himself been influenced
by the <i>De disciplinis</i> of J.L. Vivès (1531), and in all his teaching
aimed at the formation of a <i>sapiens atque eloquens pietas</i>. Latin
continued to be the living language of learning and of literature,
and a correct and elegant Latin style was regarded as the mark of
an educated person. Greek was taught in all the great schools,
but became more and more confined to the study of the Greek
Testament. In 1550 it was proposed in Brunswick to
<span class="sidenote">The Greek Testament.</span>
banish all &ldquo;profane&rdquo; authors from the schools, and in
1589 a competent scholar was instructed to write a
sacred epic on the kings of Israel as a substitute for the
works of the &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; poets. In 1637, when the doubts of Scaliger
and Heinsius as to the purity of the Greek of the New Testament
prompted the rector of Hamburg to introduce the study of
classical authors, any reflection on the style of the Greek Testament
was bitterly resented.</p>

<p>The Society of Jesus was founded in 1540, and by 1600 most
of the teachers in the Catholic schools and universities of
Germany were Jesuits. The society was &ldquo;dissolved&rdquo;
in 1773, but survived its dissolution. In accordance
<span class="sidenote">The Jesuits.</span>
with the <i>Ratio Studiorum</i> of Aquaviva (1599), which
long remained unaltered and was only partially revised by
J. Roothaan (1832), the main subjects of instruction were the
<i>litterae humaniores diversarum linguarum</i>. The chief place among
these was naturally assigned to Latin, the language of the society
and of the Roman Church. The Latin grammar in use was that
of the Jesuit rector of the school at Lisbon, Alvarez (1572).
As in the Protestant schools, the principal aim was the attainment
of <i>eloquentia</i>. A comparatively subordinate place was assigned
to Greek, especially as the importance attributed to the Vulgate
weakened the motive for studying the original text. It was
recognized, however, that Latin itself (as Vivès had said) was
&ldquo;in no small need of Greek,&rdquo; and that, &ldquo;unless Greek was
learnt in boyhood, it would hardly ever be learnt at all.&rdquo; The
text-book used was the <i>Institutiones linguae Graecae</i> of the
German Jesuit, Jacob Gretser, of Ingolstadt (c. 1590), and the
reading in the highest class included portions of Demosthenes,
Isocrates, Plato, Thucydides, Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Gregory
of Nazianzus, Basil and Chrysostom. The Catholic and Protestant
schools of the 16th century succeeded, as a rule, in giving
a command over a correct Latin style and a taste for literary
form and for culture. Latin was still the language of the law-courts
and of a large part of general literature. Between
Luther and Lessing there was no great writer of German prose.</p>

<p>(b) In the early part of the period 1650-1800, while Latin
continued to hold the foremost place, it was ceasing to be Latin
of the strictly classical type. Greek fell still further
into the background; and Homer and Demosthenes
<span class="sidenote">The age of French influence.</span>
gradually gave way to the Greek Testament. Between
1600 and 1775 there was a great gap in the production
of new editions of the principal Greek classics. The spell was
only partially broken by J.A. Ernesti&rsquo;s <i>Homer</i> (1759 f.) and
Chr. G. Heyne&rsquo;s <i>Pindar</i> (1773 f.).</p>

<p>The peace of Westphalia (1648) marks a distinct epoch in
the history of education in Germany. Thenceforth, education
became more modern and more secular. The long
wars of religion in Germany, as in France and England,
<span class="sidenote">Modern and secular education.</span>
were followed by a certain indifference as to disputed
points of theology. But the modern and secular type
of education that now supervened was opposed by the pietism
of the second half of the 17th century, represented at the newly-founded
university of Halle (1694) by A.H. Francke, the professor
of Greek (d. 1727), whose influence was far greater than
that of Chr. Cellarius (d. 1707), the founder of the first philological
<i>Seminar</i> (1697). Francke&rsquo;s contemporary, Chr. Thomasius
(d. 1728), was never weary of attacking scholarship of the old
humanistic type and everything that savoured of antiquarian
pedantry, and it was mainly his influence that made German the
language of university lectures and of scientific and learned
literature. A modern education is also the aim of the general
introduction to the <i>nova methodus</i> of Leibnitz, where the study
of Greek is recommended solely for the sake of the Greek
Testament (1666). Meanwhile, Ratichius (d. 1635) had in vain
pretended to teach Hebrew, Greek and Latin in the space of
six months (1612), but he had the merit of maintaining that
the study of a language should begin with the study of an author.
Comenius (d. 1671) had proposed to teach Latin by drilling his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
pupils in a thousand graduated phrases distributed over a
hundred instructive chapters, while the Latin authors were
banished because of their difficulty and their &ldquo;paganism&rdquo;
(1631). One of the catchwords of the day was to insist on a
knowledge of <i>things</i> instead of a knowledge of <i>words</i>, on &ldquo;realism&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;verbalism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the influence of France the perfect courtier became
the ideal in the German education of the upper classes of
the 17th and 18th centuries. A large number of
aristocratic schools (<i>Ritter-Akademien</i>) were founded,
<span class="sidenote">Ritter-akademien.</span>
beginning with the Collegium Illustre of Tübingen
(1589) and ending with the Hohe Karlschule of Stuttgart (1775).
In these schools the subjects of study included mathematics
and natural sciences, geography and history, and modern
languages (especially French), with riding, fencing and dancing;
Latin assumed a subordinate place, and classical composition
in prose or verse was not considered a sufficiently courtly accomplishment.
The youthful aristocracy were thus withdrawn
from the old Latin schools of Germany, but the aristocratic
schools vanished with the dawn of the 19th century, and the
ordinary public schools were once more frequented by the
young nobility.</p>

<p>(c) <i>The Modern Period.</i>&mdash;In the last third of the 18th century
two important movements came into play, the &ldquo;naturalism&rdquo;
of Rousseau and the &ldquo;new humanism.&rdquo; While
Rousseau sought his ideal in a form of education and
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;new humanism.&rdquo;</span>
of culture that was in close accord with nature, the
German apostles of the new humanism were convinced
that they had found that ideal completely realized in the old
Greek world. Hence the aim of education was to make young
people thoroughly &ldquo;Greek,&rdquo; to fill them with the &ldquo;Greek&rdquo;
spirit, with courage and keenness in the quest of truth, and
with a devotion to all that was beautiful.
<span class="sidenote">Herder.</span>
The link between the naturalism of Rousseau and the new humanism is
to be found in J.G. Herder, whose passion for all that
is Greek inspires him with almost a hatred of Latin. The new
humanism was a kind of revival of the Renaissance, which had
been retarded by the Reformation in Germany and by the
Counter-Reformation in Italy, or had at least been degraded
to the dull classicism of the schools. The new humanism
agreed with the Renaissance in its unreserved recognition of
the old classical world as a perfect pattern of culture. But,
while the Renaissance aimed at reproducing the Augustan age
of <i>Rome</i>, the new humanism found its golden age in <i>Athens</i>.
The Latin Renaissance in Italy aimed at recovering and verbally
imitating the ancient literature; the Greek Renaissance in
Germany sought inspiration from the creative originality of
Greek literature with a view to producing an original literature
in the German language. The movement had its effect on the
schools by discouraging the old classical routine of verbal
imitation, and giving a new prominence to Greek and to German.
The new humanism found a home in Göttingen (1783) in the days
of J.M. Gesner and C.G. Heyne. It was represented at Leipzig
by Gesner&rsquo;s successor, Ernesti (d. 1781); and at Halle by F.A.
Wolf, who in 1783 was appointed professor of education by
Zedlitz, the minister of Frederick the Great. In literature, its
leading names were Winckelmann, Lessing and Voss, and Herder,
Goethe and Schiller. The tide of the new movement had
reached its height about 1800. Goethe and Schiller were convinced
that the old Greek world was the highest revelation of
humanity; and the universities and schools of Germany were
reorganized in this spirit by F.A. Wolf and his illustrious pupil,
Wilhelm von Humboldt. In 1809-1810 Humboldt was at the
<span class="sidenote">School reorganization.</span>
head of the educational section of the Prussian Home
Office, and, in the brief interval of a year and a half,
gave to the general system of education the direction
which it followed (with slight exceptions) throughout
the whole century. In 1810 the <i>examen pro facultate docendi</i>
first made the profession of a schoolmaster independent of that
of a minister of religion. The new scheme drawn up by J.W.
Süvern recognized four principal co-ordinated branches of
learning: Latin, Greek, German, mathematics. All four were
studied throughout the school, Greek being begun in the fourth
of the nine classes, that corresponding to the English &ldquo;third
form.&rdquo; The old Latin school had only one main subject, the
study of Latin style (combined with a modicum of Greek). The
new gymnasium aimed at a wider education, in which literature
was represented by Latin, Greek and German, by the side of
mathematics and natural science, history and religion. The
uniform employment of the term <i>Gymnasium</i> for the highest type
of a Prussian school dates from 1812. The leaving examination
(<i>Abgangsprüfung</i>), instituted in that year, required Greek translation
at sight, with Greek prose composition, and ability to speak
and to write Latin. In 1818-1840 the leading spirit on the
board of education was Johannes Schulze, and a <i>complete</i> and
comprehensive system of education continued to be the ideal
kept in view. Such an education, however, was found in practice
to involve a prolongation of the years spent at school and a
correspondingly later start in life. It was also attacked on the
ground that it led to &ldquo;overwork.&rdquo; This attack was partially
met by the scheme of 1837. Schulze&rsquo;s period of prominence in
Berlin closely corresponded to that of Herbart at Königsberg
(1809-1833) and Göttingen (1833-1841), who insisted that for
boys of eight to twelve there was no better text-book than the
Greek <i>Odyssey</i>, and this principle was brought into practice at
Hanover by his distinguished pupil, Ahrens.</p>

<p>The Prussian policy of the next period, beginning with the
accession of Friedrich Wilhelm IV. in 1840, was to lay a new
stress on religious teaching, and to obviate the risk of overwork
resulting from the simultaneous study of all subjects by the
encouragement of specialization in a few. Ludwig Wiese&rsquo;s
scheme of 1856 insisted on the retention of Latin verse as well as
Latin prose, and showed less favour to natural science, but it
awakened little enthusiasm, while the attempt to revive the old
humanistic Gymnasium led to a demand for schools of a more
modern type, which issued in the recognition of the <i>Realgymnasium</i>
(1859).</p>

<p>In the age of Bismarck, school policy in Prussia had for its aim
an increasing recognition of modern requirements. In 1875
Wiese was succeeded by Bonitz, the eminent Aristotelian
scholar, who in 1849 had introduced mathematics and natural
science into the schools of Austria, and had substituted the wide
reading of classical authors for the prevalent practice of speaking
and writing Latin. By his scheme of 1882 natural science
recovered its former position in Prussia, and the hours assigned in
each week to Latin were diminished from 86 to 77. But neither
of the two great parties in the educational world was satisfied;
and great expectations were aroused when the question of reform
was taken up by the German emperor, William II., in 1890.
The result of the conference of December 1890 was a compromise
between the conservatism of a majority of its members and the
forward policy of the emperor. The scheme of 1892 reduced the
number of hours assigned to Latin from 77 to 62, and laid
special stress on the <i>German</i> essay; but the modern training
given by the <i>Realgymnasium</i> was still unrecognized as an avenue
to a university education. A conference held in June 1900, in
which the speakers included Mommsen and von Wilamowitz,
Harnack and Diels, was followed by the &ldquo;Kiel Decree&rdquo; of the
26th of November. In that decree the emperor urged the equal
recognition of the classical and the modern <i>Gymnasium</i>, and
emphasized the importance of giving more time to Latin and to
English in both. In the teaching of Greek, &ldquo;useless details&rdquo;
were to be set aside, and special care devoted to the connexion
between ancient and modern culture, while, in all subjects,
attention was to be paid to the classic precept: <i>multum, non
multa</i>.</p>

<p>By the scheme of 1901 the pupils of the <i>Realgymnasium</i>, the
<i>Oberrealschule</i> and the <i>Gymnasium</i> were admitted to the university
on equal terms in virtue of their leaving-certificates, but
Greek and Latin were still required for students of classics or
divinity.</p>

<p>For the <i>Gymnasium</i> the aim of the new scheme is, in <i>Latin</i>,
&ldquo;to supply boys with a sound basis of grammatical training,
with a view to their understanding the more important classical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
writers of Rome, and being thus introduced to the intellectual
life and culture of the ancient world&rdquo;; and, in <i>Greek</i>, &ldquo;to give
them a sufficient knowledge of the language with a view to their
obtaining an acquaintance with some of the Greek classical
works which are distinguished both in matter and in style, and
thus gaining an insight into the intellectual life and culture of
Ancient Greece.&rdquo; In consequence of these changes Greek is now
studied by a smaller number of boys, but with better results, and
a new lease of life has been won for the classical <i>Gymnasium</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, by the side of the classical <i>Gymnasium</i>, we now have
the &ldquo;German Reform Schools&rdquo; of two different types, that of
Altona (dating from 1878) and that of Frankfort-on-the-Main
(1892). The leading principle in both is the postponement of the
time for learning Latin. Schools of the Frankfort type take
French as their only foreign language in the first three years of
the course, and aim at achieving in six years as much as has been
achieved by the <i>Gymnasia</i> in nine; and it is maintained that,
in six years, they succeed in mastering a larger amount of Latin
literature than was attempted a generation ago, even in the best
<i>Gymnasia</i> of the old style. It may be added that in all the
German <i>Gymnasia</i>, whether reformed or not, more time is given
to classics than in the corresponding schools in England.</p>

<p>(4) In the <i>United States of America</i> the highest degree of
educational development has been subsequent to the Civil War.
The study of Latin begins in the &ldquo;high schools,&rdquo; the
average age of admission being fifteen and the normal
<span class="sidenote">United States.</span>
course extending over four years. Among classical
teachers an increasing number would prefer a longer course
extending over six years for Latin, and at least three for Greek,
and some of these would assign to the elementary school the first
two of the proposed six years of Latin study. Others are content
with the late learning of Latin and prefer that it should be
preceded by a thorough study of modern languages (see Prof. B.I.
Wheeler, in Baumeister&rsquo;s <i>Handbuch</i>, 1897, ii. 2, pp. 584-586).</p>

<p>It was mainly owing to a pamphlet issued in 1871 by Prof.
G.M. Lane, of Harvard, that a reformed pronunciation of Latin
was adopted in all the colleges and schools of the
United States. Some misgivings on this reform found
<span class="sidenote">Latin pronunciation.</span>
expression in a work on the <i>Teaching of Latin</i>, published
by Prof. C.E. Bennett of Cornell in 1901, a year
in which it was estimated that this pronunciation was in use by
more than 96% of the Latin pupils in the secondary schools.</p>

<p>Some important statistics as to the number studying Latin
and Greek in the secondary schools were collected in 1900 by a
committee of twelve educational experts representing all parts of
the Union, with a view to a uniform course of instruction being
pursued in all classical schools. They had the advantage of the
co-operation of Dr W.T. Harris, the U.S. commissioner of
education, and they were able to report that, in all the five
groups into which they had divided the states, the number of
pupils pursuing the study of Latin and Greek showed a remarkable
advance, especially in the most progressive states of the
middle west. The number learning Latin had increased from
100,144 in 1890 to 314,856 in 1899-1900, and those learning
Greek from 12,869 to 24,869. Thus the number learning Latin at
the later date was three times, and the number learning Greek
twice, as many as those learning Latin or Greek ten years
previously. But the total number in 1000 was 630,048; so that,
notwithstanding this proof of progress, the number learning
Greek in 1900 was only about one twenty-fifth of the total
number, while the number learning Latin was as high as half.</p>

<p>The position of Greek as an &ldquo;elective&rdquo; or &ldquo;optional&rdquo; subject
(notably at Harvard), an arrangement regarded with approval by
some eminent educational authorities and with regret by others,
probably has some effect on the high schools in the small number
of those who learn Greek, and in their lower rate of increase, as
compared with those who learn Latin. Some evidence as to the
quality of the study of those languages in the schools is supplied
by English commissioners in the <i>Reports of the Mosely Commission</i>.
Thus Mr Papillon considered that, while the teaching of
English literature was admirable, the average standard of Latin
and Greek teaching and attainment in the upper classes was
&ldquo;below that of an English public school&rdquo;; he felt, however,
that the secondary schools of the United States had a &ldquo;greater
variety of the curriculum to suit the practical needs of life,&rdquo; and
that they existed, not &ldquo;for the select few,&rdquo; but &ldquo;for the whole
people&rdquo; (pp. 250 f.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLASSIFICATION<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (Lat. <i>classis</i>, a class, probably from the
root <i>cal-</i>, <i>cla-</i>, as in Gr. <span class="grk" title="kaleô">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#969;</span>, <i>clamor</i>), a logical process, common
to all the special sciences and to knowledge in general, consisting
in the collection under a common name of a number of objects
which are alike in one or more respects. The process consists
in observing the objects and abstracting from their various
qualities that characteristic which they have in common. This
characteristic constitutes the definition of the &ldquo;class&rdquo; to which
they are regarded as belonging. It is this process by which we
arrive first at &ldquo;species&rdquo; and then at &ldquo;genus,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> at all scientific
generalization. Individual things, regarded as such, constitute
a mere aggregate, unconnected with one another, and so far
unexplained; scientific knowledge consists in systematic classification.
Thus if we observe the heavenly bodies individually
we can state merely that they have been observed to have certain
motions through the sky, that they are luminous, and the like.
If, however, we compare them one with another, we discover
that, whereas all partake in the general movement of the heavens,
some have a movement of their own. Thus we arrive at a system
of classification according to motion, by which fixed stars are
differentiated from planets. A further classification according
to other criteria gives us stars of the first magnitude and stars
of the second magnitude, and so forth. We thus arrive at a
systematic understanding expressed in laws by the application
of which accurate forecasts of celestial phenomena can be made.
Classification in the strict logical sense consists in discovering
the casual interrelation of natural objects; it thus differs from
what is often called &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; classification, which is the
preparation, <i>e.g.</i> of statistics for particular purposes, administrative
and the like.</p>

<p>Of the systems of classification adopted in physical science,
only one requires treatment here, namely, the classification of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
the sciences as a whole, a problem which has from the time of
Aristotle attracted considerable attention. Its object is to
delimit the spheres of influence of the positive sciences and show
how they are mutually related. Of such attempts three are
specially noteworthy, those of Francis Bacon, Auguste Comte
and Herbert Spencer.</p>

<p>Bacon&rsquo;s classification is based on the subjective criterion of
the various faculties which are specially concerned. He thus
distinguished History (natural, civil, literary, ecclesiastical) as
the province of memory, Philosophy (including Theology) as
that of reason, and Poetry, Fables and the like, as that of
imagination. This classification was made the basis of the
<i>Encyclopédie</i>. Comte adopted an entirely different system based
on an objective criterion. Having first enunciated the theory
that all science passes through three stages, theological, metaphysical
and positive, he neglects the two first, and divides the
last according to the &ldquo;things to be classified,&rdquo; in view of their
real affinity and natural connexions, into six, in order of decreasing
generality and increasing complexity&mdash;mathematics, astronomy,
physics, chemistry, physiology and biology (including
psychology), and sociology. This he conceives to be not only
the logical, but also the historical, order of development, from
the abstract and purely deductive to the concrete and inductive.
Sociology is thus the highest, most complex, and most positive
of the sciences. Herbert Spencer, condemning this division as
both incomplete and theoretically unsound, adopted a three-fold
division into (1) <i>abstract</i> science (including logic and mathematics)
dealing with the universal forms under which all knowledge of
phenomena is possible, (2) <i>abstract-concrete</i> science (including
mechanics, chemistry, physics), dealing with the elements of
phenomena themselves, <i>i.e.</i> laws of forces as deducible from
the persistence of forces, and (3) <i>concrete</i> science (<i>e.g.</i> astronomy,
biology, sociology), dealing with &ldquo;phenomena themselves in
their totalities,&rdquo; the universal laws of the continuous redistribution
of Matter and Motion, Evolution and Dissolution.</p>

<p>Beside the above three systems several others deserve brief
mention. In Greece at the dawn of systematic thought the
physical sciences were few in number; none the less philosophers
were not agreed as to their true relation. The Platonic school
adopted a triple classification, physics, ethics and dialectics;
Aristotle&rsquo;s system was more complicated, nor do we know
precisely how he subdivided his three main classes, theoretical,
practical and poetical (<i>i.e.</i> technical, having to do with <span class="grk" title="poiêsis">&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>,
creative). The second class covered ethics and politics, the
latter of which was often regarded by Aristotle as including
ethics; the third includes the useful and the imitative sciences;
the first includes metaphysics and physics. As regards pure
logic Aristotle sometimes seems to include it with metaphysics
and physics, sometimes to regard it as ancillary to all the sciences.</p>

<p>Thomas Hobbes (<i>Leviathan</i>) drew up an elaborate paradigm
of the sciences, the first stage of which was a dichotomy into
&ldquo;Naturall Philosophy&rdquo; (&ldquo;consequences from the accidents
of bodies naturall&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Politiques and Civill Philosophy&rdquo;
(&ldquo;consequences from accidents of Politique bodies&rdquo;). The
former by successive subdivisions is reduced to eighteen special
sciences; the latter is subdivided into the rights and duties of
sovereign powers, and those of the subject.</p>

<p>Jeremy Bentham and A.M. Ampère both drew up elaborate
systems based on the principle of dichotomy, and beginning
from the distinction of mind and body. Bentham invented
an artificial terminology which is rather curious than valuable.
The science of the body was Somatology, that of the mind Pneumatology.
The former include Posology (science of quantity,
mathematics) and Poiology (science of quality); Posology
includes Morphoscopic (geometry) and Alegomorphic(arithmetic).
See further Bentham&rsquo;s <i>Chrestomathia</i> and works quoted under
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bentham, Jeremy</a></span>.</p>

<p>Carl Wundt criticized most of these systems as taking too little
account of the real facts, and preferred a classification based on
the standpoint of the various sciences towards their subject-matter.
His system may, therefore, be described as conceptional.
It distinguishes philosophy, which deals with facts in their widest
universal relations, from the special sciences, which consider
facts in the light of a particular relation or set of relations.</p>

<p>All these systems have a certain value, and are interesting
as throwing light on the views of those who invented them. It
will be seen, however, that none can lay claim to unique validity.
The <i>fundamenta divisionis</i>, though in themselves more or less
logical, are quite arbitrarily chosen, generally as being germane
to a preconceived philosophical or scientific theory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAUBERG, JOHANN<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (1622-1665), German philosopher,
was born at Solingen, in Westphalia, on the 24th of February
1622. After travelling in France and England, he studied the
Cartesian philosophy under John Raey at Leiden. He became
(1649) professor of philosophy and theology at Herborn, but
subsequently (1651), in consequence of the jealousy of his
colleagues, accepted an invitation to a similar post at Duisburg,
where he died on the 31st of January 1665. Clauberg was one
of the earliest teachers of the new doctrines in Germany and an
exact and methodical commentator on his master&rsquo;s writings.
His theory of the connexion between the soul and the body is
in some respects analogous to that of Malebranche; but he is
not therefore to be regarded as a true forerunner of Occasionalism,
as he uses &ldquo;Occasion&rdquo; for the stimulus which directly produces
a mental phenomenon, without postulating the intervention
of God (H. Müller, <i>J. Clauberg und seine Stellung im Cartesianismus</i>).
His view of the relation of God to his creatures is held
to foreshadow the pantheism of Spinoza. All creatures exist
only through the continuous creative energy of the Divine
Being, and are no more independent of his will than are our
thoughts independent of us,&mdash;or rather less, for there are thoughts
which force themselves upon us whether we will or not. For
metaphysics Clauberg suggested the names <i>ontosophy</i> or <i>ontology</i>,
the latter being afterwards adopted by Wolff. He also devoted
considerable attention to the German languages, and his researches
in this direction attracted the favourable notice of
Leibnitz. His chief works are: <i>De conjunctione animae et
corporis humani</i>; <i>Exercitationes centum de cognitione Dei et
nostri</i>; <i>Logica vetus et nova</i>; <i>Initiatio philosophi, seu Dubitatio
Cartesiana</i>; a commentary on Descartes&rsquo; <i>Meditations</i>; and
<i>Ars etymologica Teutonum</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">CLAUDE, JEAN<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (1619-1687), French Protestant divine, was
born at La Sauvetat-du-Dropt near Agen. After studying at
Montauban, he entered the ministry in 1645. He was for eight
years professor of theology in the Protestant college of Nîmes;
but in 1661, having successfully opposed a scheme for re-uniting
Catholics and Protestants, he was forbidden to preach in Lower
Languedoc. In 1662 he obtained a post at Montauban similar
to that which he had lost; but after four years he was removed
from this also. He next became pastor at Charenton near Paris,
where he engaged in controversies with Pierre Nicole (<i>Réponse
aux deux traités intitulés la perpétuité de la foi</i>, 1665), Antoine
Arnauld (<i>Réponse au livre de M. Arnauld</i>, 1670), and J.B.
Bossuet (<i>Réponse au livre de M. l&rsquo;évêque de Meaux</i>, 1683).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
On the revocation of the edict of Nantes he fled to Holland, and
received a pension from William of Orange, who commissioned
him to write an account of the persecuted Huguenots (<i>Plaintes
des protestants cruellement opprimés dans le royaume de France</i>,

James II, both the translation and the original were publicly
burnt by the common hangman on the 5th of May 1686, as

France.&rdquo; Other works by him were <i>Réponse au livre de P. Nouet

<p><span class="bold">CLAUDE OF LORRAINE<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Claude Gelée</span> (1600-1682),
French landscape-painter, was born of very poor parents at the
village of Chamagne in Lorraine. When it was discovered that
he made no progress at school, he was apprenticed, it is commonly
said, to a pastry-cook, but this is extremely dubious. At the
age of twelve, being left an orphan, he went to live at Freiburg
on the Rhine with an elder brother, Jean Gelée, a wood-carver
of moderate merit, and under him he designed arabesques and
foliage. He afterwards rambled to Rome to seek a livelihood;
but from his clownishness and ignorance of the language, he
failed to obtain permanent employment. He next went to
Naples, to study landscape painting under Godfrey Waals, a
painter of much repute. With him he remained two years;
then he returned to Rome, and was domesticated until April
1625 with another landscape-painter, Augustin Tassi, who hired
him to grind his colours and to do all the household drudgery.</p>

<p>His master, hoping to make Claude serviceable in some of his
greatest works, advanced him in the rules of perspective and the
elements of design. Under his tuition the mind of Claude began
to expand, and he devoted himself to artistic study with great
eagerness. He exerted his utmost industry to explore the true
principles of painting by an incessant examination of nature;
and for this purpose he made his studies in the open fields, where
he very frequently remained from sunrise till sunset, watching
the effect of the shifting light upon the landscape. He generally
sketched whatever he thought beautiful or striking, marking
every tinge of light with a similar colour; from these sketches
he perfected his landscapes. Leaving Tassi, he made a tour in
Italy, France and a part of Germany, including his native
Lorraine, suffering numerous misadventures by the way. Karl
Dervent, painter to the duke of Lorraine, kept him as assistant
for a year; and he painted at Nancy the architectural subjects
on the ceiling of the Carmelite church. He did not, however,
relish this employment, and in 1627 returned to Rome. Here,
painting two landscapes for Cardinal Bentivoglio, he earned
the protection of Pope Urban VIII, and from about 1637 he
rapidly rose into celebrity. Claude was acquainted not only
with the facts, but also with the laws of nature; and the German
painter Joachim von Sandrart relates that he used to explain,
as they walked together through the fields, the causes of the
different appearances of the same landscape at different hours of
the day, from the reflections or refractions of light, or from the
morning and evening dews or vapours, with all the precision of
a natural philosopher. He elaborated his pictures with great
care; and if any performance fell short of his ideal, he altered,
erased and repainted it several times over.</p>

<p>His skies are aerial and full of lustre, and every object harmoniously
illumined. His distances and colouring are delicate,
and his tints have a sweetness and variety till then unexampled.
He frequently gave an uncommon tenderness to his finished trees
by glazing. His figures, however, are very indifferent; but he
was so conscious of his deficiency in this respect, that he usually
engaged other artists to paint them for him, among whom were
Courtois and Filippo Lauri. Indeed, he was wont to say that he
sold his landscapes and gave away his figures. In order to avoid
a repetition of the same subject, and also to detect the very
numerous spurious copies of his works, he made tinted outline
drawings (in six paper books prepared for this purpose) of all
those pictures which were transmitted to different countries;
and on the back of each drawing he wrote the name of the
purchaser. These books he named <i>Libri di verità</i>. This valuable
work (now belonging to the duke of Devonshire) has been engraved
and published, and has always been highly esteemed by students
of the art of landscape. Claude, who had suffered much from
gout, died in Rome at the age of eighty-two, on the 21st (or
perhaps the 23rd) of November 1682, leaving his wealth, which
was considerable, between his only surviving relatives, a nephew
and an adopted daughter (? niece).</p>

<p>Many choice specimens of his genius may be seen in the
National Gallery and in the Louvre; the landscapes in the
Altieri and Colonna palaces in Rome are also of especial celebrity.
A list has been printed showing no less than 92 examples in the
various public galleries of Europe. He himself regarded a landscape
which he painted in the Villa Madama, being a cento of
various views with great abundance and variety of leafage, and
a composition of Esther and Ahasuerus, as his finest works; the
former he refused to sell, although Clement IX. offered to cover
its surface with gold pieces. He etched a series of twenty-eight
landscapes, fine impressions of which are greatly prized. Full
of amenity, and deeply sensitive to the graces of nature, Claude
was long deemed the prince of landscape painters, and he must
always be accounted a prime leader in that form of art, and
in his day a great enlarger and refiner of its province.</p>

<p>Claude was a man of amiable and simple character, very kind
to his pupils, a patient and unwearied worker; in his own sphere
of study, his mind was stored (as we have seen) with observation
and knowledge, but he continued an unlettered man till his
death. Famous and highly patronized though he was in all his
later years, he seems to have been very little known to his brother
artists, with the single exception of Sandrart. This painter is
the chief direct authority for the facts of Claude&rsquo;s life (<i>Academia
Artis Pictoriae</i>, 1683); Baldinucci, who obtained information
from some of Claude&rsquo;s immediate survivors, relates various
incidents to a different effect (<i>Notizie dei professori del disegno</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAUDET, ANTOINE FRANÇOIS JEAN<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (1797-1867), French
photographer, was born at Lyons on the 12th of August 1797.
Having acquired a share in L.J.M. Daguerre&rsquo;s invention, he was
one of the first to practise daguerreotype portraiture in England,
and he improved the sensitizing process by using chlorine in
addition to iodine, thus gaining greater rapidity of action. In
1848 he produced the photographometer, an instrument designed
to measure the intensity of photogenic rays; and in 1849 he
brought out the focimeter, for securing a perfect focus in photographic
portraiture. He was elected a fellow of the Royal
Society in 1853, and in 1858 he produced the stereomonoscope,
in reply to a challenge from Sir David Brewster. He died in
London on the 27th of December 1867.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAUDIANUS, CLAUDIUS<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span>, Latin epic poet and panegyrist,
flourished during the reign of Arcadius and Honorius. He was
an Egyptian by birth, probably an Alexandrian, but it may be
conjectured from his name and his mastery of Latin that he was
of Roman extraction. His own authority has been assumed for
the assertion that his first poetical compositions were in Greek,
and that he had written nothing in Latin before <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 395; but
this seems improbable, and the passage (<i>Carm. Min.</i> xli. 13)
which is taken to prove it does not necessarily bear this meaning.
In that year he appears to have come to Rome, and made his
début as a Latin poet by a panegyric on the consulship of Olybrius
and Probinus, the first brothers not belonging to the imperial
family who had ever simultaneously filled the office of consul.
This piece proved the precursor of the series of panegyrical poems
which compose the bulk of his writings. In Birt&rsquo;s edition a
complete chronological list of Claudian&rsquo;s poems is given, and
also in J.B. Bury&rsquo;s edition of Gibbon (iii. app. i. p. 485), where
the dates given differ slightly from those in the present article.</p>

<p>In 396 appeared the encomium on the third consulship of the
emperor Honorius, and the epic on the downfall of Rufinus, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>
unworthy minister of Arcadius at Constantinople. This revolution
was principally effected by the contrivance of Stilicho, the
great general and minister of Honorius. Claudian&rsquo;s poem appears
to have obtained his patronage, or rather perhaps that of his wife
Serena, by whose interposition the poet was within a year or two
enabled to contract a wealthy marriage in Africa (<i>Epist.</i> 2).
Previously to this event he had produced (398) his panegyric on
the fourth consulship of Honorius, his epithalamium on the
marriage of Honorius to Stilicho&rsquo;s daughter, Maria, and his poem
on the Gildonic war, celebrating the repression of a revolt in
Africa. To these succeeded his piece on the consulship of
Manlius Theodorus (399), the unfinished or mutilated invective
against the Byzantine prime minister Eutropius in the same year,
the epics on Stilicho&rsquo;s first consulship and on his repulse of Alaric
(400 and 403), and the panegyric on the sixth consulship of
Honorius (404). From this time all trace of Claudian is lost, and
he is generally supposed to have perished with his patron Stilicho
in 408. It may be conjectured that he must have died in 404, as
he could hardly otherwise have omitted to celebrate the greatest
of Stilicho&rsquo;s achievements, the destruction of the barbarian host
led by Radagaisus in the following year. On the other hand, he
may have survived Stilicho, as in the dedication to the second
book of his epic on the <i>Rape of Proserpine</i> (which Birt, however,
assigns to 395-397), he speaks of his disuse of poetry in terms
hardly reconcilable with the fertility which he displayed during
his patron&rsquo;s lifetime. From the manner in which Augustine
alludes to him in his <i>De civitate Dei</i>, it may be inferred that he
was no longer living at the date of the composition of that work,
between 415 and 428.</p>

<p>Besides Claudian&rsquo;s chief poems, his lively Fescennines on the
emperor&rsquo;s marriage, his panegyric on Serena, and the <i>Gigantomachia</i>,
a fragment of an unfinished Greek epic, may also be
mentioned. Several poems expressing Christian sentiments are
undoubtedly spurious. Claudian&rsquo;s paganism, however, neither
prevented his celebrating Christian rulers and magistrates nor his
enjoying the distinction of a court laureate. It is probable that he
was nominally a Christian, like his patron Stilicho and Ausonius,
although at heart attached to the old religion. The very decided
statements of Orosius and Augustine as to his heathenism may be
explained by the pagan style of Claudian&rsquo;s political poems. We
have his own authority for his having been honoured by a bronze
statue in the forum, and Pomponius Laetus discovered in the
15th century an inscription (<i>C.I.L.</i> vi. 1710) on the pedestal,
which, formerly considered spurious, is now generally regarded as
genuine.</p>

<p>The position of Claudian&mdash;the last of the Roman poets&mdash;is
unique in literature. It is sufficiently remarkable that, after
nearly three centuries of torpor, the Latin muse should have
experienced any revival in the age of Honorius, nothing less than
amazing that this revival should have been the work of a foreigner,
most surprising of all that a just and enduring celebrity should
have been gained by official panegyrics on the generally uninteresting
transactions of an inglorious epoch. The first of these
particulars bespeaks Claudian&rsquo;s taste, rising superior to the
prevailing barbarism, the second his command of language, the
third his rhetorical skill. As remarked by Gibbon, &ldquo;he was
endowed with the rare and precious talent of raising the meanest,
of adorning the most barren, and of diversifying the most
similar topics.&rdquo; This gift is especially displayed in his poem on
the downfall of Rufinus, where the punishment of a public malefactor
is exalted to the dignity of an epical subject by the
magnificence of diction and the ostentation of supernatural
machinery. The noble exordium, in which the fate of Rufinus is
propounded as the vindication of divine justice, places the subject
at once on a dignified level; and the council of the infernal
powers has afforded a hint to Tasso, and through him to Milton.
The inevitable monotony of the panegyrics on Honorius is
relieved by just and brilliant expatiation on the duties of a
sovereign. In his celebration of Stilicho&rsquo;s victories Claudian
found a subject more worthy of his powers, and some passages,
such as the description of the flight of Alaric, and of Stilicho&rsquo;s
arrival at Rome, and the felicitous parallel between his triumphs
and those of Marius, rank among the brightest ornaments of
Latin poetry. Claudian&rsquo;s panegyric, however lavish and
regardless of veracity, is in general far less offensive than usual in
his age, a circumstance attributable partly to his more refined
taste and partly to the genuine merit of his patron Stilicho.
He is a valuable authority for the history of his times, and is
rarely to be convicted of serious inaccuracy in his facts, whatever
may be thought of the colouring he chooses to impart to them.
He was animated by true patriotic feeling, in the shape of a
reverence for Rome as the source and symbol of law, order and
civilization. Outside the sphere of actual life he is less successful;
his <i>Rape of Proserpine</i>, though the beauties of detail are as
great as usual, betrays his deficiency in the creative power
requisite for dealing with a purely ideal subject. This denotes
the rhetorician rather than the poet, and in general it may be said
that his especial gifts of vivid natural description, and of copious
illustration, derived from extensive but not cumbrous erudition,
are fully as appropriate to eloquence as to poetry. In the
general cast of his mind and character of his writings, and
especially, in his faculty for bestowing enduring interest upon
occasional themes, we may fitly compare him with Dryden,
remembering that while Dryden exulted in the energy of a
vigorous and fast-developing language, Claudian was cramped
by an artificial diction, confined to the literary class.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The editio princeps of Claudian was printed at Vicenza in 1482;
the editions of J.M. Gesner (1759) and P. Burmann (1760) are still
valuable for their notes. The first critical edition was that of L.
Jeep (1876-1879), now superseded by the exhaustive work of T.
Birt, with bibliography, in <i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica</i> (x.,
1892; smaller ed. founded on this by J. Koch, Teubner series, 1893).
There is a separate edition with commentary and verse translation of
<i>Il Ratto di</i> <span class="correction" title="amended from Prosperpina"><i>Proserpina</i></span>, by L. Garces de Diez (1889); the satire <i>In
Eutropium</i> is discussed by T. Birt in <i>Zwei politische Satiren des alten

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAUDIUS<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus</span>],
Roman emperor <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 41-54, son of Drusus and Antonia, nephew
of the emperor Tiberius, and grandson of Livia, the wife of
Augustus, was born at Lugdunum (Lyons) on the 1st of August
10 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> During his boyhood he was treated with contempt,
owing to his weak and timid character and his natural infirmities;
the fact that he was regarded as little better than an imbecile
saved him from death at the hands of Caligula. He chiefly devoted
himself to literature, especially history, and until his accession
he took no real part in public affairs, though Caligula honoured
him with the dignity of consul. He was four times married:
to Plautia Urgulanilla, whom he divorced because he suspected
her of designs against his life; to Aelia Petina, also divorced;
to the infamous Valeria Messallina (<i>q.v.</i>); and to his niece
Agrippina.</p>

<p>In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 41, on the murder of Caligula, Claudius was seized
by the praetorians, and declared emperor. The senate, which
had entertained the idea of restoring the republic, was obliged
to acquiesce. One of Claudius&rsquo;s first acts was to proclaim an
amnesty for all except Cassius Chaerea, the assassin of his predecessor,
and one or two others. After the discovery of a
conspiracy against his life in 42, he fell completely under the
influence of Messallina and his favourite freedmen Pallas and
Narcissus, who must be held responsible for acts of cruelty
which have brought undeserved odium upon the emperor.
There is no doubt that Claudius was a liberal-minded man of
kindly nature, anxious for the welfare of his people. Humane
regulations were made in regard to freedmen, slaves, widows
and orphans; the police system was admirably organized;
commerce was put on a sound footing; the provinces were
governed in a spirit of liberality; the rights of citizens and
admission to the senate were extended to communities outside
Italy. The speech of Claudius delivered (in the year 48) in the
senate in support of the petition of the Aeduans that their
senators should have the <i>jus petendorum honorum</i> (claim of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
admission to the senate and magistracies) at Rome has been
partly preserved on the fragment of a bronze tablet found at
Lyons in 1524; an imperial edict concerning the citizenship of
the Anaunians (15th of March 46) was found in the southern
Tirol in 1869 (<i>C.I.L.</i> v. 5050). Claudius was especially fond
of building. He completed the great aqueduct (Aqua Claudia)
begun by Caligula, drained the Lacus Fucinus, and built the
harbour of Ostia. Nor were his military operations unsuccessful.
Mauretania was made a Roman province; the conquest of
Britain was begun; his distinguished general Domitius Corbulo
(<i>q.v.</i>) gained considerable successes in Germany and the East.
The intrigues of Narcissus caused Messallina to be put to death
by order of Claudius, who took as his fourth wife his niece
Agrippina, a woman as criminal as any of her predecessors.
She prevailed upon him to set aside his own son Britannicus in
favour of Nero, her son by a former marriage; and in 54, to
make Nero&rsquo;s position secure, she put the emperor to death by
poison. The apotheosis of Claudius was the subject of a lampoon
by Seneca called <i>apokolokyntosis</i>, the &ldquo;pumpkinification&rdquo; of
Claudius.</p>

<p>Claudius was a prolific writer, chiefly on history, but his
works are lost. He wrote (in Greek) a history of Carthage and
a history of Etruria; (in Latin) a history of Rome from the
death of Caesar, an autobiography, and an essay in defence of
Cicero against the attacks of Asinius Gallus. He also introduced
three new letters into the Latin alphabet: &#8498; for the consonantal
V, &#8413; for BS and PS, &#747; for the intermediate sound between I
and U.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAUDIUS<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span>, the name of a famous Roman gens. The by-form
<i>Clodius</i>, in its origin a mere orthographical variant, was regularly
used for certain Claudii in late republican times, but otherwise
the two forms were used indifferently. The gens contained a
patrician and a plebeian family; the chief representatives of
the former were the Pulchri, of the latter the Marcelli (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marcellus</a></span>). The following members of the gens deserve
particular mention.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Appius Saminus Inregillensis</span>, or <span class="sc">Regillensis, Claudius</span>,
so called from Regillum (or Regilli) in Sabine territory, founder
of the Claudian gens. His original name was Attus or Attius
Clausus. About 504 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he settled in Rome, where he and his
followers formed a tribe. In 495 he was consul, and his cruel
enforcement of the laws of debtor and creditor, in opposition to
his milder colleague, P. Servilius Priscus, was one of the chief
causes of the &ldquo;secession&rdquo; of the plebs to the Sacred Mount. On
several occasions he displayed his hatred of the people, although
it is stated that he subsequently played the part of mediator.</p>

</div>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Claudius, Appius</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">Crassus</span>, a Roman patrician,
consul in 471 and 451 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and in the same and following year
one of the decemvirs. At first he was conspicuous for his
aristocratic pride and bitter hatred of the plebeians. Twice
they refused to fight under him, and fled before their enemies.
He retaliated by decimating the army. He was banished, but
soon returned, and again became consul. In the same year
(451) he was made one of the decemviri who had been appointed
to draw up a code of written laws. When it was decided to elect
decemvirs for another year, he who had formerly been looked
upon as the champion of the aristocracy, suddenly came forward
as the friend of the people, and was himself re-elected together
with several plebeians. But no sooner was the new body in
office, than it treated both patricians and plebeians with equal
violence, and refused to resign at the end of the year. Matters
were brought to a crisis by the affair of Virginia. Enamoured
of the beautiful daughter of the plebeian centurion Virginius,
Claudius attempted to seize her by an abuse of justice. One
of his clients, Marcus Claudius, swore that she was the child of
a slave belonging to him, and had been stolen by the childless
wife of the centurion. Virginius was summoned from the army,
and on the day of trial was present to expose the conspiracy.
Nevertheless, judgment was given according to the evidence
of Marcus, and Claudius commanded Virginia to be given up to
him. In despair, her father seized a knife from a neighbouring
stall and plunged it in her side. A general insurrection was the
result; and the people seceded to the Sacred Mount. The
decemvirs were finally compelled to resign and Appius Claudius
died in prison, either by his own hand or by that of the executioner.
For a discussion of the character of Appius Claudius,
see Mommsen&rsquo;s appendix to vol. i. of his <i>History of Rome</i>. He
holds that Claudius was never the leader of the patrician party,
but a patrician demagogue who ended by becoming a tyrant
to patricians as well as plebeians. The decemvirate, one of
the triumphs of the plebs, could hardly have been abolished by
that body, but would naturally have been overthrown by the
patricians. The revolution which ruined Claudius was a return to
the rule of the patricians represented by the Horatii and Valerii.</p>

</div>

<p>3. <span class="sc">Claudius, Appius</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">Caecus</span>, Roman patrician and
author. In 312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was elected censor without having passed
through the office of consul. His censorship&mdash;which he retained
for five years, in spite of the lex Aemilia which limited the
tenure of that office to eighteen months&mdash;was remarkable for the
actual or attempted achievement of several great constitutional
changes. He filled vacancies in the senate with men of low birth,
in some cases even the sons of freedmen (Diod. Sic. xx. 36;
Livy ix. 30; Suetonius, <i>Claudius</i>, 24). His most important
political innovation was the abolition of the old free birth,
freehold basis of suffrage. He enrolled the freedmen and
landless citizens both in the centuries and in the tribes,
and, instead of assigning them to the four urban tribes,
he distributed them through all the tribes and thus gave
them practical control of the elections. In 304, however,
Q. Fabius Rullianus limited the landless and poorer freedmen to
the four urban tribes, thus annulling the effect of Claudius&rsquo;s
arrangement. Appius Claudius transferred the charge of the
public worship of Hercules in the Forum Boarium from the
Potitian gens to a number of public slaves. He further invaded
the exclusive rights of the patricians by directing his secretary
Gnaeus Flavius (whom, though a freedman, he made a senator)
to publish the <i>legis actiones</i> (methods of legal practice) and the
list of <i>dies fasti</i> (or days on which legal business could be transacted).
Lastly, he gained enduring fame by the construction of a
road and an aqueduct, which&mdash;a thing unheard of before&mdash;he
called by his own name (Livy ix. 29; Frontinus, <i>De Aquis</i>,
115; Diod. Sic. xx. 36). In 307 he was elected consul for the
first time. In 298 he was interrex; in 296, as consul, he led the
army in Samnium, and although, with his colleague, he gained a
victory over the Etruscans and Samnites, he does not seem to
have specially distinguished himself as a soldier (Livy x. 19).
Next year he was praetor, and he was once dictator. His
character, like his namesake the decemvir&rsquo;s is not easy to define.
In spite of his political reforms, he opposed the admission of the
plebeians to the consulship and priestly offices; and, although
these reforms might appear to be democratic in character and
calculated to give preponderance to the lowest class of the people,
his probable aim was to strengthen the power of the magistrates
(and lessen that of the senate) by founding it on the popular will,
which would find its expression in the urban inhabitants and
could be most easily influenced by the magistrate. He was
already blind and too feeble to walk, when Cineas, the minister of
Pyrrhus, visited him, but so vigorously did he oppose every
concession that all the eloquence of Cineas was in vain, and the
Romans forgot past misfortunes in the inspiration of Claudius&rsquo;s
patriotism (Livy x. 13; Justin xviii. 2; Plutarch, <i>Pyrrhus</i>, 19).
The story of his blindness, however, may be merely a method of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
accounting for his cognomen. Tradition regarded it as the
punishment of his transference of the cult of Hercules from the
Potitii.</p>

<p>Appius Claudius Caecus is also remarkable as the first writer
mentioned in Roman literature. His speech against peace with
Pyrrhus was the first that was transmitted to writing, and thereby
laid the foundation of prose composition. He was the author of a
collection of aphorisms in verse mentioned by Cicero (of which a
few fragments remain), and of a legal work entitled <i>De Usurpationibus</i>.
It is very likely also that he was concerned in the
drawing up of the <i>Legis Actiones</i> published by Flavius. The
famous dictum &ldquo;Every man is the architect of his own fortune&rdquo;
is attributed to him. He also interested himself in grammatical
questions, distinguished the two sounds R and S in writing, and
did away with the letter Z.</p>

<div class="condensed">

</div>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Claudius, Publius</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">Pulcher</span>, son of (3). He
was the first of the gens who bore this surname. In 249 he was
consul and appointed to the command of the fleet in the first
Punic War. Instead of continuing the siege of Lilybaeum, he
decided to attack the Carthaginians in the harbour of Drepanum,
and was completely defeated. The disaster was commonly
attributed to Claudius&rsquo;s treatment of the sacred chickens, which
refused to eat before the battle. &ldquo;Let them drink then,&rdquo; said
the consul, and ordered them to be thrown into the sea. Having
been recalled and ordered to appoint a dictator, he gave another
instance of his high-handedness by nominating a subordinate
official, M. Claudius Glicia, but the nomination was at once overruled.
Claudius himself was accused of high treason and heavily
fined. He must have died before 246, in which year his sister
Claudia was fined for publicly expressing a wish that her brother
Publius could rise from the grave to lose a second fleet and
thereby diminish the number of the people. It is supposed that
he committed suicide.</p>

</div>

<p>5. <span class="sc">Claudius, Appius</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">Pulcher</span>, Roman statesman
and author. He served under his brother-in-law Lucullus in Asia
(72 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and was commissioned to deliver the ultimatum to
Tigranes, which gave him the choice of war with Rome or the
surrender of Mithradates. In 57 he was praetor, in 56 propraetor
in Sardinia, and in 54 consul with L. Domitius Ahenobarbus.
Through the intervention of Pompey, he became
reconciled to Cicero, who had been greatly offended because
Claudius had indirectly opposed his return from exile. In this
and certain other transactions Claudius seems to have acted from
avaricious motives,&mdash;a result of his early poverty. In 53 he
entered upon the governorship of Cilicia, in which capacity
he seems to have been rapacious and tyrannical. During this
period he carried on a correspondence with Cicero, whose letters
to him form the third book of the <i>Epistolae ad Familiares</i>.
Claudius resented the appointment of Cicero as his successor,
avoided meeting him, and even issued orders after his arrival
in the province. On his return to Rome Claudius was impeached
by P. Cornelius Dolabella on the ground of having violated the
sovereign rights of the people. This led him to make advances to
Cicero, since it was necessary to obtain witnesses in his favour
from his old province. He was acquitted, and a charge of
bribery against him also proved unsuccessful. In 50 he was
censor, and expelled many of the members of the senate, amongst
them the historian Sallust on the ground of immorality. His
connexion with Pompey brought upon him the enmity of Caesar,
at whose march on Rome he fled from Italy. Having been
appointed by Pompey to the command in Greece, in obedience to
an ambiguous oracle he crossed over to Euboea, where he died
about 48, before the battle of Pharsalus. Claudius was of a
distinctly religious turn of mind, as is shown by the interest he
took in sacred buildings (the temple at Eleusis, the sanctuary of
Amphiaraus at Oropus). He wrote a work on augury, the first
book of which he dedicated to Cicero. He was also extremely
superstitious, and believed in invocations of the dead. Cicero had
a high opinion of his intellectual powers, and considered him a
great orator (see Orelli, <i>Onomasticon Tullianum</i>).</p>

Roman emperor <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 268-270, belonged to an obscure Illyrian
family. On account of his military ability he was placed in
command of an army by Decius; and Valerian appointed him
general on the Illyrian frontier, and ruler of the provinces of the
lower Danube. During the reign of Gallienus, he was called to
Italy in order to crush Aureolus; and on the death of the
emperor (268) he was chosen as his successor, in accordance,
it was said, with his express desire. Shortly after his accession
he routed the Alamanni on the Lacus Benacus (some doubt is
thrown upon this); in 269 a great victory over the Goths at
Naïssus in Moesia gained him the title of Gothicus. In the
following year he died of the plague at Sirmium, in his fifty-sixth
year. He enjoyed great popularity, and appears to have
been a man of ability and character.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAUDIUS, MATTHIAS<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (1740-1815), German poet, otherwise
known by the <i>nom de plume</i> of <span class="sc">Asmus</span>, was born on the 15th
of August 1740 at Reinfeld, near Lübeck, and studied at Jena.
He spent the greater part of his life in the little town of Wandsbeck,
near Hamburg, where he earned his first literary reputation
by editing from 1771 to 1775, a newspaper called the <i>Wandsbecker
Bote</i> (<i>Wandsbeck Messenger</i>), in which he published a large
number of prose essays and poems. They were written in pure
and simple German, and appealed to the popular taste; in many
there was a vein of extravagant humour or even burlesque,
while others were full of quiet meditation and solemn sentiment.
In his later days, perhaps through the influence of Klopstock,
with whom he had formed an intimate acquaintance, Claudius
became strongly pietistic, and the graver side of his nature
showed itself. In 1814 he removed to Hamburg, to the house
of his son-in-law, the publisher Friedrich Christoph Perthes,
where he died on the 21st of January 1815.</p>

(1772-1842), marshal of France, was born at Mirepoix (Ariège)
on the 12th of December 1772, and served in the first campaign
of the French Revolutionary Wars as one of the volunteers of
1791. In June 1795, having distinguished himself repeatedly
in the war on the northern frontier (1792-1793) and the fighting
in the eastern Pyrenees (1793-1794), Clausel was made a general
of brigade. In this rank he served in Italy in 1798 and 1799,
and in the disastrous campaign of the latter year he won great
distinction at the battles of the Trebbia and of Novi. In 1802
he served in the expedition to S. Domingo. He became a general
of division in December 1802, and after his return to France he
was in almost continuous military employment there until in
1806 he was sent to the army of Naples. Soon after this Napoleon
made him a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. In 1808-1809
he was with Marmont in Dalmatia, and at the close of 1809 he
was appointed to a command in the army of Portugal under
Masséna.</p>

<p>Clausel took part in the Peninsular campaigns of 1810 and 1811,
including the Torres Vedras campaign, and under Marmont he
did excellent service in re-establishing the discipline, efficiency
and mobility of the army, which had suffered severely in the
retreat from Torres Vedras. In the Salamanca campaign (1812)
the result of Clausel&rsquo;s work was shown in the marching powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
of the French, and at the battle of Salamanca, Clausel, who had
succeeded to the command on Marmont being wounded, and had
himself received a severe wound, drew off his army with the
greatest skill, the retreat on Burgos being conducted by him in
such a way that the pursuers failed to make the slightest impression,
and had themselves in the end to retire from the siege of
Burgos (1812). Early in 1813 Clausel was made commander
of the Army of the North in Spain, but he was unable to avert
the great disaster of Vittoria. Under the supreme command of
Soult he served through the rest of the Peninsular War with
unvarying distinction. On the first restoration in 1814 he
submitted unwillingly to the Bourbons, and when Napoleon
returned to France, he hastened to join him. During the
Hundred Days he was in command of an army defending the
Pyrenean frontier. Even after Waterloo he long refused to
recognize the restored government, and he escaped to America,
being condemned to death in absence. He took the first opportunity
of returning to aid the Liberals in France (1820), sat in
the chamber of deputies from 1827 to 1830, and after the revolution
of 1830 was at once given a military command. At the head
of the army of Algiers, Clausel made a successful campaign,
but he was soon recalled by the home government, which desired
to avoid complications in Algeria. At the same time he was
made a marshal of France (February 1831). For some four
years thereafter he urged his Algerian policy upon the chamber
of deputies, and finally in 1835 was reappointed commander-in-chief.
But after several victories, including the taking of
Mascara in 1835, the marshal met with a severe repulse at
Constantine in 1836. A change of government in France was
primarily responsible for the failure, but public opinion attributed
it to Clausel, who was recalled in February 1837. He thereupon
retired from active service, and, after vigorously defending his
conduct before the deputies, he ceased to take part in public
affairs. He lived in complete retirement up to his death at
Secourrieu (Garonne) on the 21st of April 1842.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAUSEN, GEORGE<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (1852-&emsp;&emsp;), English painter, was born
in London, the son of a decorative artist. He attended the design
classes at the South Kensington schools from 1867-1873 with
great success. He then worked in the studio of Edwin Long,
R.A., and subsequently in Paris under Bouguereau and Robert-Fleury.
He became one of the foremost modern painters of
landscape and of peasant life, influenced to a certain extent
by the impressionists with whom he shared the view that light
is the real subject of landscape art. His pictures excel in rendering
the appearance of things under flecking outdoor sunlight,
or in the shady shelter of a barn or stable. His &ldquo;Girl at the
Gate&rdquo; was acquired for the nation by the Chantrey Trustees and
is now at the National Gallery of British Art (Tate Gallery).
He was elected associate of the Royal Academy in 1895, and as
professor of painting gave a memorable series of lectures to the
students of the schools,&mdash;published as <i>Six Lectures on Painting</i>
(1904) and <i>Aims and Ideals in Art</i> (1906).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAUSEWITZ, KARL VON<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1780-1831), Prussian general and
military writer, was born at Burg, near Magdeburg, on the 1st of
June 1780. His family, originally Polish, had settled in Germany
at the end of the previous century. Entering the army in 1792,
he first saw service in the Rhine campaigns of 1793-1794,
receiving his commission at the siege of Mainz. On his return to
garrison duty he set to work so zealously to remedy the defects
in his education caused by his father&rsquo;s poverty, that in 1801 he
was admitted to the Berlin Academy for young officers, then
directed by Scharnhorst. Scharnhorst, attracted by his pupil&rsquo;s
industry and force of character, paid special attention to his
training, and profoundly influenced the development of his mind.
In 1803, on Scharnhorst&rsquo;s recommendation, Clausewitz was made
&ldquo;adjutant&rdquo; (aide-de-camp) to Prince August, and he served in
this capacity in the campaign of Jena (1806), being captured
along with the prince by the French at Prenzlau. A prisoner in
France and Switzerland for the next two years, he returned
to Prussia in 1809; and for the next three years, as a departmental
chief in the ministry of war, as a teacher in the
military school, and as military instructor to the crown prince,
he assisted Scharnhorst in the famous reorganization of the
Prussian army. In 1810 he married the countess Marie von
Brühl.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the Russian war in 1812, Clausewitz, like
many other Prussian officers, took service with his country&rsquo;s
nominal enemy. This step he justified in a memorial, published
for the first time in the <i>Leben Gneisenaus</i> by Pertz (Berlin, 1869).
At first adjutant to General Phull, who had himself been a
Prussian officer, he served later under Pahlen at Witepsk and
Smolensk, and from the final Russian position at Kaluga he
was sent to the army of Wittgenstein. It was Clausewitz who
negotiated the convention of Tauroggen, which separated the
cause of Yorck&rsquo;s Prussians from that of the French, and began
the War of Liberation (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Yorck Von Wartenburg</a></span>; also
Blumenthal&rsquo;s <i>Die Konvention von Tauroggen</i>, Berlin, 1901). As a
Russian officer he superintended the formation of the <i>Landwehr</i> of
east Prussia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stein, Baron Vom</a></span>), and in the campaign of
1813 served as chief of staff to Count Wallmoden. He conducted
the fight at Göhrde, and after the armistice, with Gneisenau&rsquo;s
permission, published an account of the campaign (<i>Der Feldzug von
1813 bis zum Waffenstillstand</i>, Leipzig, 1813). This work was
long attributed to Gneisenau himself. After the peace of 1814
Clausewitz re-entered the Prussian service, and in the Waterloo
campaign was present at Ligny and Wavre as General Thielmann&rsquo;s
chief of staff. This post he retained till 1818, when he was promoted
major-general and appointed director of the <i>Allgemeine
Kriegsschule</i>. Here he remained till in 1830 he was made chief of
the 3rd Artillery Inspection at Breslau. Next year he became
chief of staff to Field-marshal Gneisenau, who commanded an
army of observation on the Polish frontier. After the dissolution
of this army Clausewitz returned to his artillery duties; but on
the 18th of November 1831 he died at Breslau of cholera, which
had proved fatal to his chief also, and a little previously, to his
old Russian commander Diebitsch on the other side of the
frontier.</p>

<p>His collected works were edited and published by his widow,
who was aided by some officers, personal friends of the general, in
her task. Of the ten volumes of <i>Hinterlassene Werke über Krieg
und Kriegführung</i> (Berlin, 1832-1837, later edition called
<i>Clausewitz&rsquo;s Gesammte Werke</i>, Berlin, 1874) the first three
contain Clausewitz&rsquo;s masterpiece, <i>Vom Kriege</i>, an exposition
of the philosophy of war which is absolutely unrivalled. He
produced no &ldquo;system&rdquo; of strategy, and his critics styled his
work &ldquo;negative&rdquo; and asked &ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;a-t-il fondé?</i>&rdquo; What he had
&ldquo;founded&rdquo; was that modern strategy which, by its hold on the
Prussian mind, carried the Prussian arms to victory in 1866 and
1870 over the &ldquo;systematic&rdquo; strategists Krismánic and Bazaine,
and his philosophy of war became, not only in Germany but in
many other countries, the essential basis of all serious study of
the art of war. The English and French translations (Graham,
<i>On War</i>, London, 1873; Neuens, <i>La Guerre</i>, Paris, 1849-1852; or
Vatry, <i>Théorie de la grande guerre</i>, Paris, 1899), with the German
original, place the work at the disposal of students of most
nationalities. The remaining volumes deal with military
history: vol. 4, the Italian campaign of 1796-97; vols. 5 and 6,
the campaign of 1799 in Switzerland and Italy; vol. 7, the wars
of 1812, 1813 to the armistice, and 1814; vol. 8, the Waterloo
Campaign; vols. 9 and 10, papers on the campaigns of Gustavus
Adolphus, Turenne, Luxemburg, Münnich, John Sobieski,
Frederick the Great, Ferdinand of Brunswick, &amp;c. He also wrote
<i>Über das Leben und den Charakter von Scharnhorst</i> (printed in
Ranke&rsquo;s <i>Historisch-politischer Zeitschrift</i>, 1832). A manuscript
on the catastrophe of 1806 long remained unpublished. It was
used by v. Höpfner in his history of that war, and eventually
published by the Great General Staff in 1888 (French translation,
1903). Letters from Clausewitz to his wife were published in
<i>Zeitschrift für preussische Landeskunde</i> (1876). His name is borne
by the 28th Field Artillery regiment of the German army.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAUSIUS, RUDOLF JULIUS EMMANUEL<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1822-1888),
German physicist, was born on the 2nd of January 1822 at
Köslin, in Pomerania. After attending the Gymnasium at
Stettin, he studied at Berlin University from 1840 to 1844. In
1848 he took his degree at Halle, and in 1850 was appointed
professor of physics in the royal artillery and engineering school at
Berlin. Late in the same year he delivered his inaugural lecture
as <i>Privatdocent</i> in the university. In 1855 he became an ordinary
professor at Zürich Polytechnic, accepting at the same time
a professorship in the university of Zürich In 1867 he moved
to Würzburg as professor of physics, and two years later was
appointed to the same chair at Bonn, where he died on the 24th of
August 1888. During the Franco-German War he was at the
head of an ambulance corps composed of Bonn students, and
received the Iron Cross for the services he rendered at Vionville
and Gravelotte. The work of Clausius, who was a mathematical
rather than an experimental physicist, was concerned with many
of the most abstruse problems of molecular physics. By his
restatement of Carnot&rsquo;s principle he put the theory of heat on a
truer and sounder basis, and he deserves the credit of having
made thermodynamics a science; he enunciated the second law,
in a paper contributed to the Berlin Academy in 1850, in the well-known
form, &ldquo;Heat cannot of itself pass from a colder to a hotter
body.&rdquo; His results he applied to an exhaustive development of
the theory of the steam-engine, laying stress in particular on the
conception of entropy. The kinetic theory of gases owes much to
his labours, Clerk Maxwell calling him its principal founder. It
was he who raised it, on the basis of the dynamical theory of heat,
to the level of a theory, and he carried out many numerical
determinations in connextion with it, <i>e.g.</i> of the mean free path of
a molecule. To Clausius also was due an important advance in
the theory of electrolysis, and he put forward the idea that
molecules in electrolytes are continually interchanging atoms, the
electric force not causing, but merely directing, the interchange.
This view found little favour until 1887, when it was taken up by
S.A. Arrhenius, who made it the basis of the theory of electrolytic
dissociation. In addition to many scientific papers he wrote
<i>Die Potentialfunktion und das Potential</i>, 1864, and <i>Abhandlungen
über die mechanische Wärmetheorie</i>, 1864-1867.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAUSTHAL<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Klausthal</span>, a town of Germany, in the
Prussian Harz, lying on a bleak plateau, 1860 ft. above sea-level,
50. m. by rail W.S.W. of Halberstadt. Pop. (1905) 8565.
Clausthal is the chief mining town of the Upper Harz Mountains,
and practically forms one town with Zellerfeld, which is separated
from it by a small stream, the Zellbach. The streets are broad,
opportunity for improvement having been given by fires in 1844
and 1854; the houses are mostly of wood. There are an
Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church, and a gymnasium.
Clausthal has a famous mining college with a mineralogical
museum, and a disused mint. Its chief mines are silver and lead,
but it also smelts copper and a little gold. Four or five sanatoria
are in the neighbourhood. The museum of the Upper Harz is at
Zellerfeld.</p>

<p>Clausthal was founded about the middle of the 12th century
in consequence probably of the erection of a Benedictine monastery
(closed in 1431), remains of which still exist in Zellerfeld.
At the beginning of the 16th century the dukes of Brunswick
made a new settlement here, and under their directions the
mining, which had been begun by the monks, was carried on
more energetically. The first church was built at Clausthal in
1570. In 1864 the control of the mines passed into the hands of
the state.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAVICHORD<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Clarichord</span> (Fr. <i>manicorde</i>; Ger. <i>Clavichord</i>;
Ital. <i>manicordo</i>; Span. <i>manicordio</i><a name="FnAnchor_1m" id="FnAnchor_1m" href="#Footnote_1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a>), a medieval stringed
keyboard instrument, a forerunner of the pianoforte (<i>q.v.</i>), its
strings being set in vibration by a blow from a brass tangent
instead of a hammer as in the modern instrument. The clavichord,
derived from the dulcimer by the addition of a keyboard,
consisted of a rectangular case, with or without legs, often very
elaborately ornamented with paintings and gilding. The earliest
instruments were small and portable, being placed upon a table
or stand. The strings, of finely drawn brass, steel or iron wire,
were stretched almost parallel with the keyboard over the
narrow belly or soundboard resting on the soundboard bridges,
often three in number, and wound as in the piano round wrest
or tuning pins set in a block at the right-hand side of the soundboard
and attached at the other end to hitch pins. The bridges
served to direct the course of the strings and to conduct the
sound waves to the soundboard. The scaling, or division of
the strings determining their vibrating length, was effected by the
position of the tangents. These tangents, small wedge-shaped
blades of brass, beaten out at the top, were inserted in the end
of the arm of the keys. As the latter were depressed by the
fingers the tangents rose to strike the strings and stop them
at the proper length from the belly-bridge. Thus the string was
set in vibration between the point of impact and the belly-bridge
just as long as the key was pressed down. The key being
released, the vibrations were instantly stopped by a list of cloth
acting as damper and interwoven among the strings behind the
line of the tangents.</p>

<p>There were two kinds of clavichords&mdash;the fretted or <i>gebunden</i>
and the fret-free or <i>bund-frei</i>. The term &ldquo;fretted&rdquo; was applied
to those clavichords which, instead of being provided with a
string or set of strings in unison for each note, had one set of
strings acting for three or four notes, the arms of the keys being
twisted in order to bring the contact of the tangent into the
acoustically correct position under the string. The &ldquo;fret-free&rdquo;
were chromatically-scaled instruments. The first <i>bund-frei</i>
clavichord is attributed to Daniel Faber of Crailsheim in Saxony
about 1720. This important change in construction increased
the size of the instrument, each pair of unison strings requiring
a key and tangent of its own, and led to the introduction of the
system of tuning by equal temperament upheld by J.S. Bach.
Clavichords were made with pedals.<a name="FnAnchor_2m" id="FnAnchor_2m" href="#Footnote_2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>The tone of the clavichord, extremely sweet and delicate,
was characterized by a tremulous hesitancy, which formed its
great charm while rendering it suitable only for the private
music room or study. Between 1883 and 1893 renewed attention
was drawn to the instrument by A.J. Hipkins&rsquo;s lectures and
recitals on keyboard instruments in London, Oxford and Cambridge;
and Arnold Dolmetsch reintroduced the art of making
clavichords in 1894.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAVICYTHERIUM<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span>, a name usually applied to an upright
spinet (<i>q.v.</i>), the soundboard and strings of which were vertical
instead of horizontal, being thus perpendicular to the keyboard;
but it would seem that the clavicytherium proper is distinct
from the upright spinet in that its strings are placed horizontally.
In the early clavicytherium there was, as in the spinet, only one
string (of gut) to each key, set in vibration by means of a small
quill or leather plectrum mounted on a jack which acted as in
the spinet and harpsichord (<i>q.v.</i>). The clavicytherium or keyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>
cythera or cetra, names which in the 14th and 15th centuries
had been applied somewhat indiscriminately to instruments
having strings stretched over a soundboard and plucked by
fingers or plectrum, was probably of Italian<a name="FnAnchor_1n" id="FnAnchor_1n" href="#Footnote_1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> or possibly of south
German origin. Sebastian Virdung,<a name="FnAnchor_2n" id="FnAnchor_2n" href="#Footnote_2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> writing early in the 16th
century, describes the clavicytherium as a new invention, having
gut strings, and gives an illustration of it. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pianoforte</a></span>.) A
certain amount of uncertainty exists as to its exact construction,
due to the extreme rarity of unrestored specimens extant, and to
the almost total absence of trustworthy practical information.</p>

<p>In a unique specimen with two keyboards dating from the 16th
or 17th century, which is in the collection of Baron Alexandre
Kraus,<a name="FnAnchor_3n" id="FnAnchor_3n" href="#Footnote_3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a> what appear to be vibrating strings stretched over a
soundboard perpendicular to the keyboard are in reality the
wires forming part of the mechanism of the action. The arrangement
of this mechanism is the distinctive feature of the clavicytherium,
for the wires, unlike the strings of the upright spinet,
increase in length from <i>left to right</i>, so that the upright harp-shaped
back has its higher side over the treble of the keyboard
instead of over the bass. The vibrating strings of the clavicytherium
in the Kraus Museum are stretched horizontally over
two kinds of psalteries fixed one over the other. The first,
serving for the lower register, is of the well-known trapezoid
shape and lies over the keyboards; it has 30 wire strings in
pairs of unisons corresponding to the 15 lowest keys. The
second psaltery resembles the kanoun of the Arabs, and has
36 strings in courses of 3 unisons corresponding to the next 12
keys, and 88 very thin strings in courses of 4, completing the
49 keys; the compass thus has a range of four octaves from
C to C. The quills of the jacks belonging to the two keyboards
are of different length and thickness. The jacks, which work
as in the spinet, are attached to the perpendicular wires, disposed
in two parallel rows, one for each keyboard.</p>

<p>There is a very fine specimen of the so-called clavicytherium
(upright spinet) in the Donaldson museum of the Royal College
of Music, London, acquired from the Correr collection at Venice
in 1885.<a name="FnAnchor_4n" id="FnAnchor_4n" href="#Footnote_4n"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The instrument is undated, but A.J. Hipkins<a name="FnAnchor_5n" id="FnAnchor_5n" href="#Footnote_5n"><span class="sp">5</span></a> placed
it early in the 16th or even at the end of the 15th century. There
is German writing on the inside of the back, referring to some
agreement at Ulm. The case is of pine-wood, and the natural
keys of box-wood. The jacks have the early steel springs, and in
1885 traces were found in the instrument of original brass
plectra, all of which point to a very early date.</p>

<p>A learned Italian, Nicolo Vicentino,<a name="FnAnchor_6n" id="FnAnchor_6n" href="#Footnote_6n"><span class="sp">6</span></a> living in the 16th century,
describes an <i>archicembalo</i> of his own invention, at which the performer
had to stand, having four rows of keys designed to obtain
a complete mesotonic pure third tuning. This was an attempt to
reintroduce the ancient Greek musical system. This instrument
was probably an upright harpsichord or clavicembalo.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAVIE, BURNING THE<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span>, an ancient Scottish custom still
observed at Burghead, a fishing village on the Moray Firth,
near Forres. The &ldquo;clavie&rdquo; is a bonfire of casks split in two,
lighted on the 12th of January, corresponding to the New Year
of the old calendar. One of these casks is joined together again
by a huge nail (Lat. <i>clavus</i>; hence the term). It is then filled
with tar, lighted and carried flaming round the village and
finally up to a headland upon which stands the ruins of a Roman
altar, locally called &ldquo;the Douro.&rdquo; It here forms the nucleus
of the bonfire, which is built up of split casks. When the burning
tar-barrel falls in pieces, the people scramble to get a lighted
piece with which to kindle the New Year&rsquo;s fire on their cottage
hearth. The charcoal of the clavie is collected and is put in
pieces up the cottage chimneys, to keep spirits and witches from
coming down.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAVIÈRE, ÉTIENNE<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> (1735-1793), French financier and politician,
was a native of Geneva. As one of the democratic leaders
there he was obliged in 1782 to take refuge in England, upon
the armed interference of France, Sardinia and Berne in favour
of the aristocratic party. There he met other Swiss, among
them Marat and Étienne Dumont, but their schemes for a new
Geneva in Ireland&mdash;which the government favoured&mdash;were
given up when Necker came to power in France, and Clavière,
with most of his comrades, went to Paris. There in 1789 he and
Dumont allied themselves with Mirabeau, secretly collaborating
for him on the <i>Courrier de Provence</i> and also in preparing
the speeches which Mirabeau delivered as his own. It was
mainly by his use of Clavière that Mirabeau sustained his
reputation as a financier. But Clavière also published some
pamphlets under his own name, and through these and his
friendship with J.P. Brissot, whom he had met in London, he
became minister of finance in the Girondist ministry, from
March to the 12th of June 1792. After the 10th of August he
was again given charge of the finances in the provisional executive
council, though with but indifferent success. He shared in the
fall of the Girondists, was arrested on the 2nd of June 1793,
but somehow was left in prison until the 8th of December, when,
on receiving notice that he was to appear on the next day before
the Revolutionary Tribunal, he committed suicide.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAVIJO, RUY GONZALEZ DE<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (d. 1412), Spanish traveller
of the 15th century, whose narrative is the first important one
of its kind contributed to Spanish literature, was a native of
Madrid, and belonged to a family of some antiquity and position.
On the return of the ambassadors Pelayo de Sotomayor and
Hernan Sanchez de Palazuelos from the court of Timur, Henry
III. of Castille determined to send another embassy to the new
lord of Western Asia, and for this purpose he selected Clavijo,
Gomez de Salazar (who died on the outward journey), and a
master of theology named Fray Alonzo Paez de Santa Maria.
They sailed from St Mary Port near Cadiz on the 22nd of May
1403, touched at the Balearic Isles, Gaeta and Rhodes, spent
some time at Constantinople, sailed along the southern coast of
the Black Sea to Trebizond, and proceeded inland by Erzerum,
the Ararat region, Tabriz, Sultanieh, Teheran and Meshed,
to Samarkand, where they were well received by the conqueror.
Their return was at last accomplished, in part after Timur&rsquo;s
death, and with countless difficulties and dangers, and they
landed in Spain on the 1st of March 1406. Clavijo proceeded
at once to the court, at that time in Alcala de Henares, and
served as chamberlain till the king&rsquo;s death (in the spring of
1406-1407); he then returned to Madrid, and lived there in
opulence till his own death on the 2nd of April 1412. He was
buried in the chapel of the monastery of St Francis, which he
had rebuilt at great expense.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are two leading MSS. of Clavijo&rsquo;s narrative&mdash;(a) London,
British Museum, Additional MSS., 16,613 fols. I, n.-125, v.; (b)
Madrid, National Library, 9218; and two old editions of the original
Spanish&mdash;(1) by Gonçalo Argote de Molina (Seville, 1582), (2) by
Antonio de Sancha (Madrid, 1782), both having the misleading titles,
apparently invented by Molina, of <i>Historia del gran Tamorlan</i>, and
<i>Vida y hazañas del gran Tamorlan</i> (the latter at the beginning of the
text itself); a better sub-title is added, viz. <i>Itinerario y enarracion
del viage y relacion de la embaxada que Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo
le hizo</i>. Both editors, and especially Sancha, supply general explanatory
dissertations. The Spanish text has also been published,
with a Russian translation, in vol. xxviii. (pp. 1-455) of the <i>Publications
of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences</i> (<i>Section of
Russian Language</i>, &amp;c.), edited by I.I. Sreznevski (1881). An
English version, by Sir Clements Markham, was issued by the Hakluyt
Society in 1859 (<i>Narrative of the Embassy of R ... G ... de Clavijo
to the Court of Timour</i>). The identification of a great number of
the places mentioned by Clavijo is a matter of considerable difficulty,
and has given rise to some discussion (see Khanikof&rsquo;s list in <i>Geographical
Magazine</i> (1874), and Sreznevski&rsquo;s <i>Annotated Index</i> in
the Russian edition of 1881). A short account ot Clavijo&rsquo;s life is

was born at Lanzarote (Canary Islands) in 1730. He settled
in Madrid, became editor of <i>El Pensador</i>, and by his campaign
against the public performance of <i>autos sacramentales</i> secured
their prohibition in 1765. In 1770 he was appointed director
of the royal theatres, a post which he resigned in order to take
up the editorship of the <i>Mercurio histórico y politico de Madrid</i>:
at the time of his death in 1806 he was secretary to the Cabinet
of Natural History. He had in abundance the courage, perseverance
and gift of pungent expression which form the equipment
of the aggressive journalist, but his work would long since
have been forgotten were it not that it put an end to a peculiarly
national form of dramatic exposition, and that his love affair
with one of Beaumarchais&rsquo; sisters suggested the theme of Goethe&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">CLAY, CASSIUS MARCELLUS<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (1810-1903), American politician,
was born in Madison county, Kentucky, on the 19th of
October 1810. He was the son of Green Clay (1757-1826), a
Kentucky soldier of the war of 1812 and a relative of Henry
Clay. He was educated at Centre College, Danville, Kentucky,
and at Yale, where he graduated in 1832. Influenced to some
extent by William Lloyd Garrison, he became an advocate of the
abolition of slavery, and on his return to his native state, at the
risk of social and political ostracism, he gave utterance to his
belief. He studied law, but instead of practising devoted
himself to a political career. In 1835, 1837 and 1840 he was
elected as a Whig to the Kentucky legislature, where he advocated
a system of gradual emancipation, and secured the establishment
of a public school system, and a much-needed reform in the jury
system. In 1841 he was defeated on account of his abolition
views. In 1844 he delivered campaign speeches for Henry Clay
throughout the North. In 1845 he established, at Lexington,
Kentucky, an anti-slavery publication known as <i>The True
American</i>, but in the same year his office and press were wrecked
by a mob, and he removed the publication office to Cincinnati,
Ohio. During this and the earlier period of his career his zeal and
hot temper involved him in numerous personal encounters and
several duels, in all of which he bore himself with a reckless
bravery. In the Mexican War he served as a captain of a
Kentucky company of militia, and was taken prisoner, while
reconnoitring, during General Scott&rsquo;s advance on the City of
Mexico. He left the Whig party in 1850, and as an anti-slavery
candidate for governor of Kentucky polled 5000 votes. In 1856
he joined the Republican party, and wielded considerable
influence as a Southern representative in its councils. In 1860
he was a leading candidate for the vice-presidential nomination.
In 1861 he was sent by President Lincoln as minister to Russia;
in 1862 he returned to America to accept a commission as major-general
of volunteers, but in March 1863 was reappointed to his
former post at St Petersburg, where he remained until 1869.
Disapproving of the Republican policy of reconstruction, he left
the party, and in 1872 was one of the organizers of the Liberal-Republican
revolt, and was largely instrumental in securing the
nomination of Horace Greeley for the presidency. In the
political campaigns of 1876 and 1880 he supported the Democratic
candidate, but rejoined the Republican party in the campaign of
1884. He died at Whitehall, Kentucky, on the 22nd of July
1903.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAY, CHARLES<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> (1801-1893), English surgeon, was born at
Bredbury, near Stockport, on the 27th of December 1801. He
began his medical education as a pupil of Kinder Wood in
Manchester (where he used to attend John Dalton&rsquo;s lectures on
chemistry), and in 1821 went to Edinburgh to continue his
studies there. Qualifying in 1823, he began a general practice in
Ashton-under-Lyne, but in 1839 removed to Manchester to
practise as an operative and consulting surgeon. It was there
that, in 1842, he first performed the operation of ovariotomy
with which his name is associated. On this occasion it was
perfectly successful, and when in 1865 he published an analysis
of 111 cases he was able to show a mortality only slightly above
30%. Although his merits in this matter have sometimes been
denied, his claim to the title &ldquo;Father of Ovariotomy&rdquo; is now
generally conceded, and it is admittted that he deserves the
credit not only of having shown how that operation could be
made a success, but also of having played an important part in
the advance of abdominal surgery for which the 19th century was
conspicuous. In spite of the claims of a heavy practice, Clay
found time for the pursuit of geology and archaeology. Among
the books of which he was the author were a volume of <i>Geological
Sketches of Manchester</i> (1839) and a <i>History of the Currency of the
Isle of Man</i> (1849), and his collections included over a thousand
editions of the Old and New Testaments and a remarkably
complete series of the silver and copper coins of the United
States. He died at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Preston, on the 19th
of September 1893.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAY, FREDERIC<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (1838-1889), English musical composer,
the son of James Clay, M.P., who was celebrated as a player of
whist and a writer on that subject, was born in Paris on the 3rd of
August 1838. He studied music under W.B. Molique in Paris
and Moritz Hauptmann at Leipzig. With the exception of a few
songs and two cantatas, <i>The Knights of the Cross</i> (1866) and
<i>Lalla Rookh</i> (1877),&mdash;the latter of which contained his well-known
song &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing thee songs of Araby,&rdquo;&mdash;his compositions
were all written for the stage. Clay&rsquo;s first public appearance was
made with an opera entitled <i>Court and Cottage</i>, the libretto of
which was written by Tom Taylor. This was produced at
Covent Garden in 1862, and was followed by <i>Constance</i> (1865),
<i>Ages Ago</i> (1869), and <i>Princess Toto</i> (1875), to name only three of
many works which have long since been forgotten. The last two,
which were written to libretti by W.S. Gilbert, are among Clay&rsquo;s
most tuneful and most attractive works. He wrote part of the
music for <i>Babil and Bijou</i> (1872) and <i>The Black Crook</i> (1873),
both of which were produced at the Alhambra. He also furnished
incidental music for a revival of <i>Twelfth Night</i> and for the
production of James Albery&rsquo;s <i>Oriana</i>. His last works, <i>The
Merry Duchess</i> (1883) and <i>The Golden Ring</i> (1883), the latter
written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned
to the ground the year before, showed an advance upon his
previous work, and rendered all the more regrettable the stroke of
paralysis which crippled his physical and mental energies during
the last few years of his life. He died at Great Marlow on the
24th of November 1889.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAY, HENRY<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> (1777-1852), American statesman and orator,
was born in Hanover county, Virginia, on the 12th of April 1777,
and died in Washington on the 29th of June 1852. Few public
characters in the United States have been the subject of more
heated controversy. His enemies denounced him as a pretender,
a selfish intriguer, and an abandoned profligate; his supporters
placed him among the sages and sometimes even among the
saints. He was an arranger of measures and leader of political
forces, not an originator of ideas and systems. His public life
covered nearly half a century, and his name and fame rest
entirely upon his own merits. He achieved his success despite
serious obstacles. He was tall, rawboned and awkward; his
early instruction was scant; but he &ldquo;read books,&rdquo; talked well,
and so, after his admission to the bar at Richmond, Virginia,
in 1797, and his removal next year to Lexington, Kentucky, he
quickly acquired a reputation and a lucrative income from his
law practice.</p>

<p>Thereafter, until the end of life, and in a field where he met,
as either friend or foe, John Quincy Adams, Gallatin, Madison,
Monroe, Webster, Jackson, Calhoun, Randolph and Benton,
his political activity was wellnigh ceaseless. At the age of
twenty-two (1799), he was elected to a constitutional convention
in Kentucky; at twenty-six, to the Kentucky legislature;
at twenty-nine, while yet under the age limit of the United
States constitution, he was appointed to an unexpired term
(1806-1807) in the United States Senate, where, contrary to
custom, he at once plunged into business, as though he had been
there all his life. He again served in the Kentucky legislature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>
(1808-1809), was chosen speaker of its lower house, and achieved
distinction by preventing an intense and widespread anti-British
feeling from excluding the common law from the Kentucky code.
A year later he was elected to another unexpired term in the
United States Senate, serving in 1810-1811. At thirty-four
(1811) he was elected to the United States House of Representatives
and chosen speaker on the first day of the session. One of
the chief sources of his popularity was his activity in Congress
in promoting the war with Great Britain in 1812, while as one
of the peace commissioners he reluctantly signed the treaty of
Ghent on the 24th of December 1814. During the fourteen years
following his first election, he was re-elected five times to the
House and to the speakership; retiring for one term (1821-1823)
to resume his law practice and retrieve his fortunes. He thus
served as speaker in 1811-1814, in 1815-1820 and in 1823-1825.
Once he was unanimously elected by his constituents, and once
nearly defeated for having at the previous session voted to increase
congressional salaries. He was a warm friend of the Spanish-American
revolutionists (1818) and of the Greek insurgents
(1824). From 1825 to 1829 he served as secretary of state in
President John Quincy Adams&rsquo;s cabinet, and in 1831 he was
elected to the United States Senate, where he served until 1842,
and again from 1849 until his death.</p>

<p>From the beginning of his career he was in favour of internal
improvements as a means of opening up the fertile but inaccessible
West, and was opposed to the abuse of official patronage
known as &ldquo;the spoils system.&rdquo; The most important of the
national questions with which Clay was associated, however,
were the various phases of slavery politics and protection to
home industries. The most prominent characteristics of his
public life were his predisposition to &ldquo;compromises&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pacifications&rdquo; which generally failed of their object, and his
passionate patriotic devotion to the Union.</p>

<p>His earliest championship of protection was a resolution
introduced by him in the Kentucky legislature (1808) which
favoured the wearing by its members of home-made
clothes; and one in the United States Senate (April
<span class="sidenote">His career as a Protectionist.</span>
1810), on behalf of home-grown and home-made
supplies for the United States navy, but only to the
point of making the nation independent of foreign supply. In
1816 he advocated the Dallas tariff, in which the duties ranged
up to 35% on articles of home production, the supply of which
could satisfy the home demand; the avowed purpose being to
build up certain industries for safety in time of war. In 1824
he advocated high duties to relieve the prevailing distress, which
he pictured in a brilliant and effective speech. Although the
distress was caused by the reactionary effect of a disordered
currency and the inflated prices of the war of 1812, he ascribed
it to the country&rsquo;s dependence on foreign supply and foreign
markets. Great Britain, he said, was a shining example of the
wisdom of a high tariff. No nation ever flourished without one.
He closed his principal speech on the subject in the House of
Representatives with a glowing appeal in behalf of what he
called &ldquo;The American System.&rdquo; In spite of the opposition of
Webster and other prominent statesmen, Clay succeeded in
enacting a tariff which the people of the Southern states denounced
as a &ldquo;tariff of abominations.&rdquo; As it overswelled the
revenue, in 1832 he vigorously favoured reducing the tariff rates
on all articles not competing with American products. His speech
in behalf of the measure was for years a protection text-book;
but the measure itself reduced the revenue so little and provoked
such serious threats of nullification and secession in South
Carolina, that, to prevent bloodshed and to forestall a free trade
measure from the next Congress, Clay brought forward in 1833
a compromise gradually reducing the tariff rates to an average
of 20%. To the Protectionists this was &ldquo;like a crash of thunder
in winter&rdquo;; but it was received with such favour by the country
generally, that its author was hailed as &ldquo;The Great Pacificator,&rdquo;
as he had been thirteen years before at the time of the Missouri
Compromise (see below). As, however, the discontent with
the tariff in the South was only a symptom of the real
trouble there&mdash;the sensitiveness of the slave-power,&mdash;Clay
subsequently confessed his serious doubts of the policy of his
interference.</p>

<p>He was only twenty-two, when, as an opponent of slavery,
he vainly urged an emancipation clause for the new constitution
of Kentucky, and he never ceased regretting that its failure put
his state, in improvements and progress, behind its free neighbours.
In 1820 he congratulated the new South American
republics on having abolished slavery, but the same year the
threats of the Southern states to destroy the Union led him to
advocate the &ldquo;Missouri Compromise,&rdquo; which, while keeping
slavery out of all the rest of the territory acquired by the
&ldquo;Louisiana Purchase&rdquo; north of Missouri&rsquo;s southern boundary
line, permitted it in that state. Then, greeted with the title
of &ldquo;The Great Pacificator&rdquo; as a reward for his success, he
retired temporarily to private life, with a larger stock of popularity
than he had ever had before. Although at various times
he had helped to strengthen the law for the recovery of fugitive
slaves, declining as secretary of state to aid Great Britain in the
further suppression of the slave trade, and demanding the
return of fugitives from Canada, yet he heartily supported
the colonizing of the slaves in Africa, because slavery was the
&ldquo;deepest stain upon the character of the country,&rdquo; opposition
to which could not be repressed except by &ldquo;blowing out the moral
lights around,&rdquo; and &ldquo;eradicating from the human soul the light
of reason and the law of liberty.&rdquo; When the slave power
became more aggressive, in and after the year 1831, Clay defended
the right of petition for the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia, and opposed Calhoun&rsquo;s bill forbidding the use of the
mails to &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; newspapers and documents. He was luke-warm
toward recognizing the independence of Texas, lest it should
aid the increase of slave territory, and generally favoured the
freedom of speech and press as regards the question of slavery;
yet his various concessions and compromises resulted, as he himself
declared, in the abolitionists denouncing him as a slaveholder,
and the slaveholders as an abolitionist. In 1839, only
twelve months after opposing the pro-slavery demands, he prepared
an elaborate speech, in order &ldquo;to set himself right with the
South,&rdquo; which, before its delivery, received pro-slavery approval.
While affirming that he was &ldquo;no friend of slavery&rdquo; he held
abolition and the abolitionists responsible for the hatred, strife,
disruption and carnage that menaced the nation. In response,
Calhoun extended to him a most hearty welcome, and assigned
him to a place on the bench of the penitents. Being a candidate
for the presidency Clay had to take the insult without wincing.
It was in reference to this speech that he made the oft-quoted
remark that he &ldquo;would rather be right than be president.&rdquo;
While a candidate for president in 1844, he opposed in the
&ldquo;Raleigh letter&rdquo; the annexation of Texas on many grounds
except that of its increasing the slave power, thus displeasing
both the men of anti-slavery and those of pro-slavery sentiments.
In 1847, after the conquest of Mexico, he made a speech against
the annexation of that country or the acquiring of any foreign
territory for the spread of slavery. Although in 1849 he again
vainly proposed emancipation in Kentucky, he was unanimously
elected to the United States Senate, where in 1850 he temporarily
pacified both sections of the country by successfully offering,
for the sake of the &ldquo;peace, concord and harmony of these
states,&rdquo; a measure or series of measures that became known as
the &ldquo;Compromise of 1850.&rdquo; It admitted California as a free state,
organized Utah and New Mexico as Territories without reference
to slavery, and enacted a more efficient fugitive slave law. In
spite of great physical weakness he made several earnest speeches
in behalf of these measures to save the Union.</p>

<p>Another conspicuous feature of Clay&rsquo;s public career was his
absorbing and rightful, but constantly ungratified, ambition to
be president of the United States. His name in connexion
therewith was mentioned comparatively early, and in 1824,
with W.H. Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy
Adams, he was a candidate for that office. There being no choice
by the people, and the House of Representatives having elected
Adams, Clay was accused by Jackson and his friends of making
a corrupt bargain whereby, in payment of his vote and influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
for Adams, he was appointed secretary of state. This made
Jackson Clay&rsquo;s lifelong enemy, and ever after kept Clay busy
explaining and denying the allegation. In 1832 Clay was unanimously
nominated for the presidency by the National Republicans;
Jackson, by the Democrats. The main issue was the policy
of continuing the United States Bank, which in 1811 Clay had
opposed, but in 1816 and always subsequently warmly favoured.
A majority of the voters approved of Jackson&rsquo;s fight against
what Clay had once denounced as a dangerous and unconstitutional
monopoly. Clay made the mistake of supposing that he
could arouse popular enthusiasm for a moneyed corporation in
its contest with the great military &ldquo;hero of New Orleans.&rdquo;
In 1839 he was a candidate for the Whig nomination, but by a
secret ballot his enemies defeated him in the party convention,
held in December of that year, and nominated William Henry
Harrison. The result threw Clay into paroxysms of rage, and
he violently complained that his friends always used him as
their candidate when he was sure to be defeated, and betrayed
him when he or any one could have been elected. In 1844 he
was nominated by the Whigs against James K. Polk, the Democratic
candidate. By an audacious fraud that represented him
as an enemy, and Polk as a friend of protection, Clay lost the
vote of Pennsylvania; and he lost the vote of New York by
his own letter abating the force of his previous opposition to
the annexation of Texas. Even his enemies felt that his defeat
by Polk was almost a national calamity. In 1848, Zachary
Taylor, a Mexican War hero, and hardly even a convert to the
Whig party, defeated Clay for the nomination, Kentucky
herself deserting her &ldquo;favourite son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clay&rsquo;s quick intelligence and sympathy, and his irreproachable
conduct in youth, explain his precocious prominence in public
affairs. In his persuasiveness as an orator and his charming
personality lay the secret of his power. He had early trained
himself in the art of speech-making, in the forest, the field and
even the barn, with horse and ox for audience. By contemporaries
his voice was declared to be the finest musical instrument
that they ever heard. His eloquence was in turn majestic,
fierce, playful, insinuating; his gesticulation natural, vivid,
large, powerful. In public he was of magnificent bearing,
possessing the true oratorical temperament, the nervous exaltation
that makes the orator feel and appear a superior being,
transfusing his thought, passion and will into the mind and
heart of the listener; but his imagination frequently ran away
with his understanding, while his imperious temper and ardent
combativeness hurried him and his party into disadvantageous
positions. The ease, too, with which he outshone men of vastly
greater learning lured him from the task of intense and arduous
study. His speeches were characterized by skill of statement,
ingenious grouping of facts, fervent diction, and ardent patriotism;
sometimes by biting sarcasm, but also by superficial
research, half-knowledge and an unwillingness to reason a
proposition to its logical results. In private, his never-failing
courtesy, his agreeable manners and a noble and generous
heart for all who needed protection against the powerful or the
lawless, endeared him to hosts of friends. His popularity was
as great and as inexhaustible among his neighbours as among
his fellow-citizens generally. He pronounced upon himself a
just judgment when he wrote: &ldquo;If any one desires to know the
leading and paramount object of my public life, the preservation
of this Union will furnish him the key.&rdquo;</p>

(from Gr. <span class="grk" title="pêlos">&#960;&#951;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span>, clay), <i>e.g.</i> mudstone, shale, slate: these exhibit
in greater or less perfection the properties above described
according to their freedom from impurities. In nature, clays are
rarely free from foreign ingredients, many of which can be
detected with the unaided eye, while others may be observed
by means of the microscope. The commonest impurities are:&mdash;
(1) organic matter, humus, &amp;c. (exemplified by clay-soils with
an admixture of peat, oil shales, carbonaceous shales); (2)
fossils (such as plants in the shales of the Lias and Coal Measures,
shells in clays of all geological periods and in fresh water marls);
(3) carbonate of lime (rarely altogether absent, but abundant
in marls, cement-stones and argillaceous limestones); (4)
sulphide of iron, as pyrite or marcasite (when finely diffused,
giving the clay a dark grey-blue colour, which weathers to
brown&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> London Clay; also as nodules and concretions,
<i>e.g.</i> Gault); (5) oxides of iron (staining the clay bright red when
ferric oxide, red ochre; yellow when hydrous, <i>e.g.</i> yellow
ochre); (6) sand or detrital silica (forming loams, arenaceous
clays, argillaceous sandstones, &amp;c.). Less frequently present
are the following:&mdash;rock salt (Triassic clays, and marls of
Cheshire, &amp;c.); gypsum (London Clay, Triassic clays); dolomite,
phosphate of lime, vivianite (phosphate of iron), oxides of
manganese, copper ores (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Kupferschiefer</i>), wavellite and
amber. As the impurities increase in amount the clay rocks
pass gradually into argillaceous sands and sandstones, argillaceous
limestones and dolomites, shaly coals and clay
ironstones.</p>

<p>Natural clays, even when most pure, show a considerable
range of composition, and hence cannot be regarded as consisting
of a single mineral; clay is a <i>rock</i>, and has that variability which
characterizes all rocks. Of the essential properties of clay some
are merely physical, and depend on the minute size of the
particles. If any rock be taken (even a piece of pure quartz) and
crushed to a very fine powder, it will show some of the peculiarities
of clays; for example, it will be plastic, retentive of
moisture, impermeable to water, and will shrink to some extent if
the moist mass be kneaded, and then allowed to dry. It happens,
however, that many rocks are not disintegrated to this extreme
degree by natural processes, and weathering invariably accompanies
disintegration. Quartz, for example, has little or no
cleavage, and is not attacked by the atmosphere. It breaks up
into fragments, which become rounded by attrition, but after
they reach a certain minuteness are borne along by currents of
water or air in a state of suspension, and are not further reduced
in size. Hence sands are more coarse grained than clays. A
great number of rock-forming minerals, however, possess a good
cleavage, so that when bruised they split into thin fragments;
many of these minerals decompose somewhat readily, yielding
secondary minerals, which are comparatively soft and have a
scaly character, with eminently perfect cleavages, which facilitate
splitting into exceedingly thin plates. The principal substances
of this description are kaolin, muscovite and chlorite. Kaolin
and muscovite are formed principally after felspar (and the
felspars are the commonest minerals of all crystalline rocks);
also from nepheline, leucite, scapolite and a variety of other
rock-forming minerals. Chlorite arises from biotite, augite and
hornblende. Serpentine, which may be fibrous or scaly, is a
secondary product of olivine and certain pyroxenes. Clays
consist essentially of the above ingredients (although serpentine
is not known to take part in them to any extent, it is closely
allied to chlorite). At the same time other substances are
produced as decomposition goes on. They are principally finely
divided quartz, epidote, zoisite, rutile, limonite, calcite, pyrites,
and very small particles of these are rarely absent from
natural clays. These fine-grained materials are at first mixed
with broken and more or less weathered rock fragments
and coarser mineral particles in the soil and subsoil, but by
the action of wind and rain they are swept away and deposited
in distant situations. &ldquo;Loess&rdquo; is a fine calcareous clay,
which has been wind-borne, and subsequently laid down on the
margins of dry steppes and deserts. Most clays are water-borne,
having been carried from the surface of the land by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>
rain and transported by the brooks and rivers into lakes or
the sea. In this state the fine particles are known as &ldquo;mud.&rdquo;
They are deposited where the currents are checked and the water
becomes very still. If temporarily laid down in other situations
they are ultimately lifted again and removed. A little clay,
stirred up with water in a glass vessel, takes hours to settle, and
even after two or three days some remains in suspension; in fact,
it has been suggested that in such cases the clay forms a sort of
&ldquo;colloidal solution&rdquo; in the water. Traces of dissolved salts,
such as common salt, gypsum or alum, greatly accelerate
deposition. For these reasons the principal gathering places of
fine pure clays are deep, still lakes, and the sea bottom at considerable
distances from the shore. The coarser materials settle
nearer the land, and the shallower portions of the sea floor are
strewn with gravel and sand, except in occasional depressions
and near the mouths of rivers where mud may gather. Farther
out the great mud deposits begin, extending from 50 to 200 m.
from the land, according to the amount of sediment brought in,
and the rate at which the water deepens. A girdle of mud
accumulations encircles all the continents. These sediments are
fine and tenacious; their principal components, in addition to
clay, being small grains of quartz, zircon, tourmaline, hornblende,
felspar and iron compounds. Their typical colour is blackish-blue,
owing to the abundance of sulphuretted hydrogen; when
fresh they have a sulphurous odour, when weathered they are
brown, as their iron is present as hydrous oxides (limonite, &amp;c).
These deposits are tenanted by numerous forms of marine life,
and the sulphur they contain is derived from decomposing
organic matter. Occasionally water-logged plant débris is
mingled with the mud. In a few places a red colour prevails, the
iron being mostly oxidized; elsewhere the muds are green
owing to abundant glauconite. Traced landwards the muds
become more sandy, while on their outer margins they grade into
the abysmal deposits, such as the globigerina ooze (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ocean
and Oceanography</a></span>). Near volcanoes they contain many
volcanic minerals, and around coral islands they are often in
large part calcareous.</p>

<p>Microscopic sections of some of the more coherent clays and
shales may be prepared by saturating them with Canada balsam
by long boiling, and slicing the resultant mass in the same
manner as one of the harder rocks. They show that clay rocks
contain abundant very small grains of quartz (about 0.01 to
0.05 mm. in diameter), with often felspar, tourmaline, zircon,
epidote, rutile and more or less calcite. These may form more
than one-third of an ordinary shale; the greater part, however,
consists of still smaller scales of other minerals (0.01 mm. in
diameter and less than this). Some of these are recognizable as
pale yellowish and white mica; others seem to be chlorite, the
remainder is perhaps kaolin, but, owing to the minute size of the
flakes, they yield very indistinct reactions to polarized light.
They are also often stained with iron oxide and organic substances,
and in consequence their true nature is almost impossible to
determine. It is certain, however, that the finer-grained rocks are
richest in alumina, and in combined water; hence the inference
is clear that kaolin or some other hydrous aluminium silicate is
the dominating constituent. These results are confirmed by the
mechanical analysis of clays. This process consists in finely
pulverizing the soil or rock, and levigating it in vessels of water.
A series of powders is obtained progressively finer according to the
time required to settle to the bottom of the vessel. The clay is
held to include those particles which have less than 0.005 mm. diameter,
and contains a higher percentage of alumina than any
of the other ingredients.</p>

<p>As might be inferred from the differences they exhibit in other
respects, clay rocks vary greatly in their chemical composition.
Some of them contain much iron (yellow, blue and red clays);
others contain abundant calcium carbonate (calcareous clays
and marls). Pure clays, however, may be found almost quite
free from these substances. Their silica ranges from about 60 to
45%, varying in accordance with the amount of quartz and
alkali-felspar present. It is almost always more than would be
the case if the rock consisted of kaolin mixed with muscovite.
Alumina is high in the finer clays (18 to 30%), and they are the
most aluminous of all sediments, except bauxite. Magnesia is
never absent, though its amount may be less than 1%; it is
usually contained in minerals of the chlorite group, but partly
also in dolomite. The alkalis are very interesting; often they
form 5 or 10% of the whole rock; they indicate abundance of
white micas or of undecomposed particles of felspar. Some clays,
however, such as fireclays, contain very little potash or soda,
while they are rich in alumina; and it is a fair inference that
hydrated aluminous silicates, such as kaolin, are well represented
in these rocks. There are, in fact, a few clays which contain
about 45% of alumina, that is to say, more than in pure kaolin.
It is probable that these are related to bauxite and certain kinds
of laterite.</p>

<p>A few of the most important clay rocks, such as china-clay,
brick-clay, red-clay and shale, may be briefly described here.</p>

<p><i>China-clay</i> is white, friable and earthy. It occurs in regions
of granite, porphyry and syenite, and usually occupies funnel-shaped
cavities of no great superficial area, but of considerable
depth. It consists of very fine scaly kaolin, larger, shining plates
of white mica, grains of quartz and particles of semi-decomposed
felspar, tourmaline, zircon and other minerals, which originally
formed part of the granite. These clays are produced by the
decomposition of the granite by acid vapours, which are discharged
after the igneous rock has solidified (&ldquo;fumarole or
pneumatolytic action&rdquo;). Fluorine and its compounds are often
supposed to have been among the agencies which produce this
change, but more probably carbonic acid played the principal
role. The felspar decomposes into kaolin and quartz; its
alkalis are for the most part set free and removed in solution,
but are partly retained in the white mica which is constantly
found in crude china-clays. Semi-decomposed varieties of the
granite are known as china-stone. The kaolin may be washed
away from its original site, and deposited in hollows or lakes to
form beds of white clay, such as pipe-clay; in this case it is
always more or less impure. Yellow and pinkish varieties of
china-clay and pipe-clay contain a small quantity of oxide of
iron. The best known localities for china-clay are Cornwall,
Limoges (France), Saxony, Bohemia and China; it is found also
in Pennsylvania, N. Carolina and elsewhere in the United States.</p>

<p><i>Fire-clays</i> include all those varieties of clay which are very
refractory to heat. They must contain little alkalis, lime,
magnesia and iron, but some of them are comparatively rich
in silica. Many of the clays which pass under this designation
belong to the Carboniferous period, and are found underlying
seams of coal. Either by rapid growth of vegetation, or by
subsequent percolation of organic solutions, most of the alkalis
and the lime have been carried away.</p>

<p>Any argillaceous material, which can be used for the manufacture
of bricks, may be called a <i>brick-clay</i>. In England,
Kimmeridge Clay, Lias clays, London Clay and pulverized
shale and slate are all employed for this purpose. Each variety
needs special treatment according to its properties. The true
brick-clays, however, are superficial deposits of Pleistocene or
Quaternary age, and occur in hollows, filled-up lakes and
deserted stream channels. Many of them are derived from the
glacial boulder-clays, or from the washing away of the finer
materials contained in older clay formations. They are always
very impure.</p>

<p>The <i>red-clay</i> is an abysmal formation, occurring in the sea
bottom in the deepest part of the oceans. It is estimated to
cover over fifty millions of square miles, and is probably the most
extensive deposit which is in course of accumulation at the
present day. In addition to the reddish or brownish argillaceous
matrix it contains fresh or decomposed crystals of volcanic
minerals, such as felspar, augite, hornblende, olivine and
pumiceous or palagonitic rocks. These must either have been
ejected by submarine volcanoes or drifted by the wind from
active vents, as the fine ash discharged by Krakatoa was wafted
over the whole globe. Larger rounded lumps of pumice, found
in the clay, have probably floated to their present situations,
and sank when decomposed, all their cavities becoming filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
with sea water. Crystals of zeolites (phillipsite) form in the
red-clay as radiate, nodular groups. Lumps of manganese oxide,
with a black, shining outer surface, are also characteristic of
this deposit, and frequently encrust pieces of pumice or animal
remains. The only fossils of the clay are radiolaria, sharks&rsquo;
teeth and the ear-bones of whales, precisely those parts of the
skeleton of marine creatures which are hardest and can longest
survive exposure to sea-water. Their comparative abundance
shows how slowly the clay gathers. Small rounded spherules
of iron, believed by some to be meteoric dust, have also been
obtained in some numbers. Among the rocks of the continents
nothing exactly the same as this remarkable deposit is known
to occur, though fine dark clays, with manganese nodules, are
found in many localities, accompanied by other rocks which
indicate deep-water conditions of deposit.</p>

<p>Another type of red-clay is found in caves, and is known as
<i>cave-earth</i> or <i>red-earth</i> (<i>terra rossa</i>). It is fine, tenacious and
bright red, and represents the insoluble and thoroughly weathered
impurities which are left behind when the calcareous matter is
removed in solution by carbonated waters. Similar residual
clays sometimes occur on the surface of areas of limestone in
hollows and fissures formed by weathering.</p>

<p><i>Boulder-clay</i> is a coarse unstratified deposit of fine clay, with
more or less sand, and boulders of various sizes, the latter usually
marked with glacial striations.</p>

<p>Some clay rocks which have been laid down by water are
very uniform through their whole thickness, and are called
<i>mud-stones</i>. Others split readily into fine leaflets or laminae
parallel to their bedding, and this structure is accentuated by
the presence of films of other materials, such as sand or vegetable
debris. Laminated clays of this sort are generally known as
<i>shales</i>; they occur in many formations but are very common
in the Carboniferous. Some of them contain much organic
debris, and when distilled yield paraffin oil, wax, compounds
of ammonia, &amp;c. In these oil-shales there are clear, globular,
yellow bodies which seem to be resinous. It has been suggested
that the admixture of large quantities of decomposed fresh-water
algae among the original mud is the origin of the paraffins.
In New South Wales, Scotland and several parts of America
such oil-shales are worked on a commercial scale. Many shales
contain great numbers of ovoid or rounded septarian nodules
of clay ironstone. Others are rich in pyrites, which, on oxidation,
produces sulphuric acid; this attacks the aluminous silicates
of the clay and forms aluminium sulphate (<i>alum shales</i>). The
lias shales of Whitby contain blocks of semi-mineralized wood,
or jet, which is black with a resinous lustre, and a fibrous
structure. The laminated structure of shales, though partly
due to successive very thin sheets of deposit, is certainly dependent
also on the vertical pressure exerted by masses of super-incumbent
rock; it indicates a transition to the fissile character
of clay slates.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAYS, PAUL JEAN<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> (1819-1900), Belgian artist, was born
at Bruges in 1819, and died at Brussels in 1900. He was one of
the most esteemed marine painters of his time, and early in his
career he substituted a sincere study of nature for the extravagant
and artificial conventionality of most of his predecessors. When
he began to paint, the sea was considered by continental artists
as worth representing only under its most tempestuous aspects.
Artists cared only for the stirring drama of storm and wreck,
and they clung still to the old-world tradition of the romantic
school. Clays was the first to appreciate the beauty of calm
waters reflecting the slow procession of clouds, the glories of
sunset illuminating the sails of ships or gilding the tarred sides
of heavy fishing-boats. He painted the peaceful life of rivers,
the poetry of wide estuaries, the regulated stir of roadsteads and
ports. And while he thus broke away from old traditions he
also threw off the trammels imposed on him by his master,
the marine painter Theodore Gudin (1802-1880). Endeavouring
only to give truthful expression to the nature that delighted his
eyes, he sought to render the limpid salt atmosphere, the weight
of waters, the transparence of moist horizons, the gem-like
sparkle of the sky. A Fleming in his feeling for colour, he set his
palette with clean strong hues, and their powerful harmonies
were in striking contrast with the rusty, smoky tones then in
favour. If he was not a &ldquo;luminist&rdquo; in the modern use of the
word, he deserves at any rate to be classed with the founders of
the modern naturalistic school. This conscientious and healthy
interpretation, to which the artist remained faithful, without any
important change, to the end of an unusually long and laborious
career, attracted those minds which aspired to be bold, and won
over those which were moderate. Clays soon took his place
among the most famous Belgian painters of his generation, and
his pictures, sold at high prices, are to be seen in most public and
private galleries. We may mention, among others, &ldquo;The Beach
at Ault,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boats in a Dutch Port,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dutch Boats in the
Flushing Roads,&rdquo; the last in the National Gallery, London.
In the Brussels gallery are &ldquo;The Port of Antwerp,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coast near
Ostend,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Calm on the Scheldt&rdquo;; in the Antwerp
museum, &ldquo;The Meuse at Dordrecht&rdquo;; in the Pinakothek at
Munich, &ldquo;The Open North Sea&rdquo;; in the Metropolitan Museum
of Fine Arts, New York, &ldquo;The Festival of the Freedom of the
Scheldt at Antwerp in 1863&rdquo;; in the palace of the king of the
Belgians, &ldquo;Arrival of Queen Victoria at Ostend in 1857&rdquo;; in
the Bruges academy, &ldquo;Port of Feirugudo, Portugal.&rdquo; Clays
was a member of several Academies, Belgian and foreign, and
of the Order of Leopold, the Legion of Honour, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAYTON, JOHN MIDDLETON<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (1796-1856), American
politician, was born in Dagsborough, Sussex county, Delaware, on
the 24th of July 1796. He came of an old Quaker family long
prominent in the political history of Delaware. He graduated
at Yale in 1815, and in 1819 began to practise law at Dover,
Delaware, where for a time he was associated with his cousin,
Thomas Clayton (1778-1854), subsequently a United States
senator and chief-justice of the state. He soon gained a large
practice. He became a member of the state House of Representatives
in 1824, and from December 1826 to October 1828 was
secretary of state of Delaware. In 1829, by a combination of
anti-Jackson forces in the state legislature, he was elected to the
United States Senate. Here his great oratorical gifts gave him
a high place as one of the ablest and most eloquent opponents
of the administration. In 1831 he was a member of the Delaware
constitutional convention, and in 1835 he was returned to the
Senate as a Whig, but resigned in the following year. In 1837-1839
he was chief justice of Delaware. In 1845 he again entered
the Senate, where he opposed the annexation of Texas and the
Mexican War, but advocated the active prosecution of the latter
once it was begun. In March 1849 he became secretary of state
in the cabinet of President Zachary Taylor, to whose nomination
and election his influence had contributed. His brief tenure
of the state portfolio, which terminated on the 22nd of July
1850, soon after Taylor&rsquo;s death, was notable chiefly for the
negotiation with the British minister, Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer,
of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty (<i>q.v.</i>). He was once more a member
of the Senate from March 1853 until his death at Dover, Delaware,
on the 9th of November 1856. By his contemporaries Clayton
was considered one of the ablest debaters and orators in the
Senate.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLAYTON-BULWER TREATY<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span>, a famous treaty between the
United States and Great Britain, negotiated in 1850 by John M.
Clayton and Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer (Lord Dalling), in consequence
of the situation created by the project of an interoceanic
canal across Nicaragua, each signatory being jealous of
the activities of the other in Central America. Great Britain
had large and indefinite territorial claims in three regions&mdash;Belize
or British Honduras, the Mosquito Coast and the Bay
Islands.<a name="FnAnchor_1o" id="FnAnchor_1o" href="#Footnote_1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> On the other hand, the United States, without territorial
claims, held in reserve, ready for ratification, treaties with
Nicaragua and Honduras, which gave her a certain diplomatic
vantage with which to balance the <i>de facto</i> dominion of Great
Britain. Agreement on these points being impossible and
agreement on the canal question possible, the latter was put in
the foreground. The resulting treaty had four essential points.
It bound both parties not to &ldquo;obtain or maintain&rdquo; any exclusive
control of the proposed canal, or unequal advantage in
its use. It guaranteed the neutralization of such canal. It
declared that, the intention of the signatories being not only the
accomplishment of &ldquo;a particular object&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that the canal,
then supposedly near realization, should be neutral and equally
free to the two contracting powers&mdash;&ldquo;but also to establish a
general principle,&rdquo; they agreed &ldquo;to extend their protection by
treaty stipulation to any other practicable communications,
whether by canal or railway, across the isthmus which connects
North and South America.&rdquo; Finally, it stipulated that neither
signatory would ever &ldquo;occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume
or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito
Coast or any part of Central America,&rdquo; nor make use of
any protectorate or alliance, present or future, to such ends.</p>

<p>The treaty was signed on the 19th of April, and was ratified
by both governments; but before the exchange of ratifications
Lord Palmerston, on the 8th of June, directed Sir H. Bulwer
to make a &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; that the British government did not
understand the treaty &ldquo;as applying to Her Majesty&rsquo;s settlement
at Honduras, or its dependencies.&rdquo; Mr Clayton made a counter-declaration,
which recited that the United States did not regard
the treaty as applying to &ldquo;the British settlement in Honduras
commonly called British-Honduras ... nor the small islands
in the neighbourhood of that settlement which may be known
as its dependencies&rdquo;; that the treaty&rsquo;s engagements did apply
to all the Central American states, &ldquo;with their just limits and
proper dependencies&rdquo;; and that these declarations, not being
submitted to the United States Senate, could of course not affect
the legal import of the treaty. The interpretation of the declarations
soon became a matter of contention. The phraseology
reflects the effort made by the United States to render impossible
a physical control of the canal by Great Britain through the
territory held by her at its mouth&mdash;the United States losing
the above-mentioned treaty advantages,&mdash;just as the explicit
abnegations of the treaty rendered impossible such control
politically by either power. But great Britain claimed that the
excepted &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; at Honduras was the &ldquo;Belize&rdquo; covered
by the extreme British claim; that the Bay Islands were a
dependency of Belize; and that, as for the Mosquito Coast, the
abnegatory clauses being wholly prospective in intent, she was
not required to abandon her protectorate. The United States
contended that the Bay Islands were not the &ldquo;dependencies&rdquo;
of Belize, these being the small neighbouring islands mentioned
in the same treaties; that the excepted &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; was the
British-Honduras of definite extent and narrow purpose recognized
in British treaties with Spain; that she had not confirmed
by recognition the large, indefinite and offensive claims
whose dangers the treaty was primarily designed to lessen; and
that, as to the Mosquito Coast, the treaty was retrospective, and
mutual in the rigour of its requirements, and as the United States
had no <i>de facto</i> possessions, while Great Britain had, the clause
binding both not to &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; any part of Central America
or the Mosquito Coast necessitated the abandonment of such
territory as Great Britain was already actually occupying or
exercising dominion over; and the United States demanded the
complete abandonment of the British protectorate over the
Mosquito Indians. It seems to be a just conclusion that when
in 1852 the Bay Islands were erected into a British &ldquo;colony&rdquo;
this was a flagrant infraction of the treaty; that as regards
Belize the American arguments were decidedly stronger, and
more correct historically; and that as regards the Mosquito
question, inasmuch as a protectorate seems certainly to have
been recognized by the treaty, to demand its absolute abandonment
was unwarranted, although to satisfy the treaty Great
Britain was bound materially to weaken it.</p>

<p>In 1859-1860, by British treaties with Central American
states, the Bay Islands and Mosquito questions were settled
nearly in accord with the American contentions.<a name="FnAnchor_2o" id="FnAnchor_2o" href="#Footnote_2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a> But by the
same treaties Belize was accorded limits much greater than
those contended for by the United States. This settlement
the latter power accepted without cavil for many years.</p>

<p>Until 1866 the policy of the United States was consistently
for inter-oceanic canals open equally to all nations, and
unequivocally neutralized; indeed, until 1880 there was practically
no official divergence from this policy. But in 1880-1884 a
variety of reasons were advanced why the United States might
justly repudiate at will the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty.<a name="FnAnchor_3o" id="FnAnchor_3o" href="#Footnote_3o"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The new
policy was based on national self-interest. The arguments
advanced on its behalf were quite indefensible in law and history,
and although the position of the United States in 1850-1860
was in general the stronger in history, law and political ethics,
that of Great Britain was even more conspicuously the stronger
in the years 1880-1884. In 1885 the former government reverted
to its traditional policy, and the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty
of 1902, which replaced the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, adopted
the rule of neutralization for the Panama Canal.</p>

even offered co-operation in the protection and neutrality-guarantee
of the Panama railway built in 1850-1855, so that her

<p><span class="bold">CLAY-WITH-FLINTS<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span>, in geology, the name given by W. Whitaker
in 1861 to a peculiar deposit of stiff red, brown or
yellow clay containing unworn whole flints as well as angular
shattered fragments, also with a variable admixture of rounded
flint, quartz, quartzite and other pebbles. It occurs &ldquo;in sheets or
patches of various sizes over a large area in the south of England,
from Hertfordshire on the north to Sussex on the south, and
from Kent on the east to Devon on the west. It almost always
lies on the surface of the Upper Chalk, but in Dorset it passes
on to the Middle and Lower Chalk, and in Devon it is found on
the Chert-Beds of the Selbornian group&rdquo; (A.J. Jukes-Browne,
&ldquo;The Clay-with-Flints, its Origin and Distribution,&rdquo; <i>Q.J.G.S.</i>,
vol. lxii., 1906, p. 132). Many geologists have supposed, and
some still hold, that the Clay-with-Flints is the residue left by
the slow solution and disintegration of the Chalk by the processes
of weathering; on the other hand, it has long been known that
the deposit very frequently contains materials foreign to the
Chalk, derived either from the Tertiary rocks or from overlying
drift. In the paper quoted above, Jukes-Browne ably summarizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>
the evidence against the view that the deposit is mainly a
Chalk residue, and brings forward a good deal of evidence to
show that many patches of the Clay-with-Flints lie upon the
same plane and may be directly associated with Reading Beds.
He concludes &ldquo;that the material of the Clay-with-Flints has been
chiefly and almost entirely derived from Eocene clay, with
addition of some flints from the Chalk; that its presence is an
indication of the previous existence of Lower Eocene Beds on
the same site and nearly at the same relative level, and, consequently,
that comparatively little Chalk has been removed
from beneath it. Finally, I think that the tracts of Clay-with-Flints
have been much more extensive than they are now&rdquo;
(loc. cit. p. 159).</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the Clay-with-Flints is developed over
an area which is just beyond the limits of the ice sheets of the
Glacial epoch, and the peculiar conditions of late Pliocene and
Pleistocene times; involving heavy rains, snow and frost, may
have had much to do with the mingling of the Tertiary and
Chalky material. Besides the occurrence in surface patches,
Clay-with-Flints is very commonly to be observed descending
in &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; often to a considerable depth into the Chalk; here,
if anywhere, the residual chalk portion of the deposit should
be found, and it is surmised that a thin layer of very dark clay
with darkly stained flints, which appears in contact with
the sides and bottom of the pipe, may represent all there is of
insoluble residue.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar deposit, a &ldquo;<i>conglomérat de silex</i>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<i>argue à silex</i>,&rdquo; occurs at the base of the Eocene on the southern
and western borders of the Paris basin, in the neighbourhood
of Chartres, Thimerais and Sancerrois.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLAZOMENAE<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (mod. <i>Kelisman</i>), an ancient town of Ionia
and a member of the Ionian Dodecapolis (Confederation of
Twelve Cities), on the Gulf of Smyrna, about 20 m. W. of that
city. Though not in existence before the arrival of the Ionians
in Asia, its original founders were largely settlers from Phlius
and Cleonae. It stood originally on the isthmus connecting
the mainland with the peninsula on which Erythrae stood;
but the inhabitants, alarmed by the encroachments of the
Persians, removed to one of the small islands of the bay, and
there established their city. This island was connected with
the mainland by Alexander the Great by means of a pier, the
remains of which are still visible. During the 5th century it
was for some time subject to the Athenians, but about the
middle of the Peloponnesian war (412 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) it revolted. After
a brief resistance, however, it again acknowledged the Athenian
supremacy, and repelled a Lacedaemonian attack. Under the
Romans Clazomenae was included in the province of Asia, and
enjoyed an immunity from taxation. The site can still be made
out, in the neighbourhood of Vourla, but nearly every portion
of its ruins has been removed. It was the birthplace of the
philosopher Anaxagoras. It is famous for its painted terra-cotta
sarcophagi, which are the finest monuments of Ionian painting
in the 6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEANTHES<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> (c. 301-232 or 252 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Stoic philosopher,
born at Assos in the Troad, was originally a boxer. With but
four drachmae in his possession he came to Athens, where he
listened first to the lectures of Crates the Cynic, and then to
those of Zeno, the Stoic, supporting himself meanwhile by
working all night as water-carrier to a gardener (hence his
nickname <span class="grk" title="phrehantlês">&#934;&#961;&#949;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#955;&#951;&#962;</span>). His power of patient endurance, or
perhaps his slowness, earned him the title of &ldquo;the Ass&rdquo;; but
such was the esteem awakened by his high moral qualities that,
on the death of Zeno in 263, he became the leader of the school.
He continued, however, to support himself by the labour of his
own hands. Among his pupils were his successor, Chrysippus,
and Antigonus, king of Macedon, from whom he accepted
2000 minae. The manner of his death was characteristic. A
dangerous ulcer had compelled him to fast for a time. Subsequently
he continued his abstinence, saying that, as he was
already half-way on the road to death, he would not trouble
to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>Cleanthes produced very little that was original, though he
wrote some fifty works, of which fragments have come down
to us. The principal is the large portion of the <i>Hymn to Zeus</i>
which has been preserved in Stobaeus. He regarded the sun
as the abode of God, the intelligent providence, or (in accordance
with Stoical materialism) the vivifying fire or aether of the
universe. Virtue, he taught, is life according to nature; but
pleasure is not according to nature. He originated a new theory
as to the individual existence of the human soul; he held that
the degree of its vitality after death depends upon the degree
of its vitality in this life. The principal fragments of Cleanthes&rsquo;s
works are contained in Diogenes Laertius and Stobaeus; some
may be found in Cicero and Seneca.</p>

Clearchus was sent with a fleet to the Hellespont in 411 and
became governor (<span class="grk" title="harmostês">&#7937;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#962;</span>) of Byzantium, of which town he was
<i>proxenus</i>. His severity, however, made him unpopular, and in
his absence the gates were opened to the Athenian besieging army
under Alcibiades (409). Subsequently appointed by the ephors
to settle the political dissensions then rife at Byzantium and to
protect the city and the neighbouring Greek colonies from
Thracian attacks, he made himself tyrant of Byzantium, and,
when declared an outlaw and driven thence by a Spartan force,
he fled to Cyrus. In the &ldquo;expedition of the ten thousand&rdquo;
undertaken by Cyrus to dethrone his brother Artaxerxes
Mnemon, Clearchus led the Peloponnesians, who formed the
right wing of Cyrus&rsquo;s army at the battle of Cunaxa (401). On
Cyrus&rsquo;s death Clearchus assumed the chief command and
conducted the retreat, until, being treacherously seized with his
fellow-generals by Tissaphernes, he was handed over to Artaxerxes
and executed (Thuc. viii. 8. 39, 80; Xen. <i>Hellenica</i>, i. 3. 15-19;
<i>Anabasis</i>, i. ii.; Diodorus xiv. 12. 19-26). In character he was a
typical product of the Spartan educational system. He was a
warrior to the finger-tips (<span class="grk" title="polemikos kai philopolemos eschatôs">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;

<p><span class="bold">CLEARFIELD<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span>, a borough and the county-seat of Clearfield
county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on the W. branch of the Susquehanna
river, in the W. central part of the state. Pop. (1890)
2248; (1900) 5081 (310 foreign-born); (1910) 6851. It is served
by the New York Central &amp; Hudson River, the Pennsylvania,
and the Buffalo, Rochester &amp; Pittsburg railways. The borough is
about 1105 ft. above sea-level, in a rather limited space between
the hills, which command picturesque views of the narrow valley.
The river runs through the borough. Coal and fireclay abound in
the vicinity, and these, with leather, iron, timber and the products
of the fertile soil, are the bases of its leading industries.
Before the arrival of the whites the place had been cleared of
timber (whence its name), and in 1805 it was chosen as a site for
the county-seat of the newly erected county and laid out as a
town; in 1840 it was incorporated as a borough.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLEARING-HOUSE<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span>, the general term for a central institution
employed in connexion with large and interrelated businesses for
the purpose of facilitating the settlement of accounts.</p>

<p><i>Banking.</i>&mdash;The London Clearing-House was established
between 1750 and 1770 as a place where the clerks of the bankers
of the city of London could assemble daily to exchange with one
another the cheques drawn upon and bills payable at their
respective houses. Before the clearing-house existed, each
banker had to send a clerk to the places of business of all
the other bankers in London to collect the sums payable by
them in respect of cheques and bills; and it is obvious that much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
time was consumed by this process, which involved the use of an
unnecessary quantity of money and corresponding risks of safe
carriage. In 1775 a room in Change Alley was settled upon as a
common centre of exchange; this was afterwards removed to
Post Office Court, Lombard Street. This clearing centre was at
first confined to the bankers&mdash;at that time and long afterwards
exclusively private bankers&mdash;doing business within the city, and
the bankers in the west end of the metropolis used some one or
other of the city banks as their agent in clearing. When the
joint-stock banks were first established, the jealousy of the
existing banks was powerful enough to exclude them altogether
from the use of the Clearing-House; and it was not until 1854
that this feeling was removed so as to allow them to be admitted.</p>

<p>At first the Clearing-House was simply a place of meeting, but
it came to be perceived that the sorting and distribution of
cheques, bills, &amp;c, could be more expeditiously conducted by the
appointment of two or three common clerks to whom each
banker&rsquo;s clerk could give all the instruments of exchange he
wished to collect, and from whom he could receive all those
payable at his own house. The payment of the balance settled
the transaction, but the arrangements were afterwards so
perfected that the balance is now settled by means of transfers
made at the Bank of England between the Clearing-House
account and those of the various banks, the Clearing-House, as
well as each banker using it, having an account at the Bank of
England. The use of the Clearing-House was still further
extended in 1858, so as to include the settlement of exchanges
between the country bankers of England. Before that time each
country banker receiving cheques on other country bankers sent
them to those other bankers by post (supposing they were not
carrying on business in the same place), and requested that the
amount should be paid by the London agent of the banker on
whom the cheques were drawn to the London agent of the banker
remitting them. Cheques were thus collected by correspondence,
and each remittance involved a separate payment in London.
Since 1858, accordingly, a country banker sends cheques on other
country banks to his London correspondent, who exchanges them
at the Clearing-House with the correspondents of the bankers on
whom they are drawn.</p>

<p>The Clearing-House consists of one long room, lighted from the
roof. Around the walls and down the centre are placed desks,
allotted to the various banks, according to the amount of their
business. The desks are arranged alphabetically, so that the
clerks may lose no time in passing round the room and delivering
their &ldquo;charges&rdquo; or batches of cheques to the representatives of
the various banks. There are three clearings in London each day.
The first is at 10.30 A.M., the second at noon, and the third at
2.30 P.M. It is the busiest of all, and continues until five minutes
past four, when the last delivery must be made. The three
clearings were, in 1907, divided into town, metropolitan and
country clearings, each with a definite area. All the clearing
banks have their cheques marked with the letters &ldquo;T,&rdquo; &ldquo;M&rdquo; and
&ldquo;C,&rdquo; according to the district in which the issuing bank is
situated. Every cheque issued by the clearing banks, even
though drawn in the head office of a bank, goes through the
Clearing-House.</p>

<p>The amount of business transacted at the Clearing-House
varies very much with the seasons of the year, the busiest time
being when dividends are paid and stock exchange settlements
are made, but the volume of transactions averages roughly from
200 to 300 millions sterling a week, and the yearly clearances
amount to something like £12,000,000,000. There are provincial
clearing-houses at Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
Leeds, Sheffield, Leicester and Bristol. There are
also clearing-houses in most of the large towns of Scotland and
Ireland. In New York and the other large cities of the United
States there are clearing-houses providing accommodation for
the various banking institutions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Banks and Banking</a></span>).</p>

<p>The progress of banking on the continent of Europe has been
slow in comparison with that of the United Kingdom, and the
use of cheques is not so general, consequently the need for
clearing-houses is not so great. In France, too, the greater
proportion of the banking business is carried on through three
banks only, the Banque de France, the Société Générale and the
Crédit Lyonnais, and a great part of their transactions are settled
at their own head offices. But at the same time large sums
pass through the Paris Chambre de Compensation (the clearing-house),
established in 1872.</p>

<p>There are clearing-houses also in Berlin, Hamburg and many
other European cities.</p>

<p><i>Railways.</i>&mdash;The British Railway Clearing-House was established
in 1842, its purpose, as defined by the Railway Clearing-House
Act of 1850, being &ldquo;to settle and adjust the receipts
arising from railway traffic within, or partly within, the United
Kingdom, and passing over more than one railway within the
United Kingdom, booked or invoiced at throughout rates or
fares.&rdquo; It is an independent body, governed by a committee
which is composed of delegates (usually the chairman or one of
the directors) from each of the railways that belong to it. Any
railway company may be admitted a party to the clearing-system
with the assent of the committee, may cease to be a member at a
month&rsquo;s notice, and may be expelled if such expulsion be voted
for by two-thirds of the delegates present at a specially convened
meeting. The cost of maintaining it is defrayed by contributions
from the companies proportional to the volume of business passed
through it by each. It has two main functions. (1) When
passengers or goods are booked through between stations
belonging to different railway companies at an inclusive charge
for the whole journey, it distributes the money received in due
proportions between the companies concerned in rendering the
service. To this end it receives, in the case of passenger traffic, a
monthly return of the tickets issued at each station to stations on
other lines, and, in the case of goods traffic, it is supplied by both
the sending and receiving stations (when these are on different
companies&rsquo; systems) with abstracts showing the character, weight,
&amp;c., of the goods that have travelled between them. By the aid
of these particulars it allocates the proper share of the receipts
to each company, having due regard to the distance over which
the traffic has been carried on each line, to the terminal services
rendered by each company, to any incidental expenses to which
it may have been put, and to the existence of any special agreements
for the division of traffic. (2) To avoid the inconvenience
of a change of train at points where the lines of different companies
meet, passengers are often, and goods and minerals
generally, carried in through vehicles from their starting-point
to their destination. In consequence, vehicles belonging to one
company are constantly forming part of trains that belong to,
and run over the lines of, other companies, which thus have the
temporary use of rolling stock that does not belong to them.
By the aid of a large staff of &ldquo;number takers&rdquo; who are stationed
at junctions all over the country, and whose business is to
record particulars of the vehicles which pass through those
junctions, the Clearing-House follows the movements of vehicles
which have left their owners&rsquo; line, ascertains how far they have
run on the lines of other companies, and debits each of the latter
with the amount it has to pay for their use. This charge is
known as &ldquo;mileage&rdquo;; another charge which is also determined
by the Clearing-House is &ldquo;demurrage,&rdquo; that is, the amount
exacted from the detaining company if a vehicle is not returned
to its owners within a prescribed time. By the exercise of these
functions the Clearing-House accumulates a long series of credits
to, and debits against, each company; these are periodically
added up and set against each other, with the result that the
accounts between it and the companies are finally settled by the
transfer of comparatively small balances. It also distributes the
money paid by the post-office to the railways on account of the
conveyance of parcel-post traffic, and through its lost luggage
department many thousands of articles left in railway carriages
are every year returned to their owners. Its situation in London
further renders it a convenient meeting-place for several &ldquo;Clearing-House
Conferences&rdquo; of railway officials, as of the general
managers, the goods managers, and the superintendents of the
line, held four times a year for the consideration of questions
in which all the companies are interested. The Irish Railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
Clearing-House, established in 1848, has its headquarters in
Dublin, and was incorporated by act of parliament in 1860.</p>

<p><i>General</i>.&mdash;The principle of clearing adopted by banks and
railways has been applied with considerable success in other
businesses.</p>

<p>In 1874 the London Stock Exchange Clearing-House was
established for the purpose of settling transactions in stock, the
clearing being effected by balance-sheets and tickets; the balance
of stock to be received or delivered is shown on a balance-sheet
sent in by each member, and the items are then cancelled against
one another and tickets issued for the balances outstanding.
The New York Stock Exchange Clearing-House was established in
1892. The settlements on the Paris Bourse are cleared within the
Bourse itself, through the Compagnie des Agents de Change de
Paris.</p>

<p>In 1888 a society was formed in London called the Beetroot
Sugar Association for clearing bargains in beetroot sugar. For
every 500 bags of sugar of a definite weight which a broker sells,
he issues a <i>filière</i> (a form something like a dock-warrant), giving
particulars as to the ship, the warehouse, trade-marks, &amp;c. The
filière contains also a series of transfer forms which are filled up
and signed by each successive holder, so transferring the property
to a new purchaser. The new purchaser also fills up a coupon
attached to the transfer, quoting the date and hour of sale. This
coupon is detached by the seller and retained by him as evidence
to determine any liability through subsequent delay in the
delivery of the sugar. Any purchaser requiring delivery of the
sugar forwards the filière to the clearing-house, and the officials
then send on his name to the first seller who tenders him the
warrant direct. These filières pass from hand to hand within a
limit of six days, a stamp being affixed on each transfer as a
clearing-house fee. The difference between each of the successive
transactions is adjusted by the clearing-house to the profit or loss
of the seller.</p>

<p>The London Produce Clearing-House was established in 1888
for regulating and adjusting bargains in foreign and colonial
produce. The object of the association is to guarantee both to
the buyer and the seller the fulfilment of bargains for future
delivery. The transactions on either side are allowed to accumulate
during a month and an adjustment made at the end by a
settlement of the final balance owing. On the same lines are the
Caisse de Liquidation at Havre and the Waaren Liquidations
Casse at Hamburg. The Cotton Association also has a clearing-house
at Liverpool for clearing the transactions which arise from
dealings in cotton.</p>

improved, but the voice is probably saved from much of the
unpleasant tone which is usually associated with a defective
roof to the mouth and is apt to persist even if a cleft has been
successfully operated on later in childhood. The greatest advance
which has been made in the operative treatment of cleft palate
is due to the teaching of Dr Truman W. Brophy, who adopted
the ingenious plan of thrusting together to the middle line of
the mouth the halves of the palate which nature had unfortunately
left apart. But, as noted above, this operation must, to
give the best results, be undertaken in the earliest months of
infancy. After the cleft in the palate has been effectually dealt
with, the hare-lip can be repaired with ease and success.</p>

<p><i>Hare-lip</i>.&mdash;In the hare the splitting of the lip is in the middle
line, but in the human subject it is on one side, or on both sides
of the middle line. This is accounted for on developmental
grounds: a cleft in the exact middle line is of extremely rare
occurrence. Hare-lip is often associated with cleft palate.
Though we are at present unable to explain why development
should so frequently miss the mark in connexion with the formation
of the lip and palate, it is unlikely that maternal impressions
have anything to do with it. As a rule, the supposed &ldquo;fright&rdquo;
comes long after the lips are developed. They are completely
formed by the ninth week. Heredity has a powerful influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>479</span>
in many cases. The best time for operating on a hare-lip depends
upon various circumstances. Thus, if it is associated with cleft
palate, the palatine cleft has first to be closed, in which case the
child will probably be several months old before the lip is operated
on. If the infant is in so poor a state of nutrition that it appears
unsuitable for surgical treatment, the operation must be postponed
until his condition is sufficiently improved. But, assuming
that the infant is in fair health, that he is taking his food well and
thriving on it, that he is not troubled by vomiting or diarrhoea,
and that the hare-lip is not associated with a defective palate,
the sooner it is operated on the better. It may be successfully
done even within a few hours of birth. When a hare-lip is
unassociated with cleft palate, the infant may possibly be enabled
to take the breast within a short time of the gap being closed.
In such a case the operation may be advisably undertaken
within the first few days of birth. The case being suitable, the
operation may be conveniently undertaken at any time after
the tenth day.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEISTHENES<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span>, the name of two Greek statesmen, (1) of
Athens, (2) of Sicyon, of whom the first is far the more important.</p>

<p class="pt2">1. <span class="sc">Cleisthenes</span>, the Athenian statesman, was the son of
Megacles and Agariste, daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon. He
thus belonged, through his father, to the noble family of the
Alcmaeonidae (<i>q.v.</i>), who bore upon them the curse of the Cylonian
massacre, and had been in exile during the rule of the Peisistratids.
In the hope of washing out the stigma, which damaged
their prestige, they spent the latter part of their exile in carrying
out with great splendour the contract given out by the Amphictyons
for the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi (destroyed
by fire in 548 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). By building the pronaos of Parian marble
instead of limestone as specified in the contract, they acquired
a high reputation for piety; the curse was consigned to oblivion,
and their reinstatement was imposed by the oracle itself upon
the Spartan king, Cleomenes (<i>q.v.</i>). Cleisthenes, to whom this
far-seeing atonement must probably be attributed, had also on
his side (1) the malcontents in Athens who were disgusted with
the growing severity of Hippias, and (2) the oligarchs of Sparta,
partly on religious grounds, and partly owing to their hatred
of tyranny. Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Constitution of Athens</i>, however, treats
the alliance of the Peisistratids with Argos, the rival of Sparta
in the Peloponnese, as the chief ground for the action of Sparta
(<i>c.</i> 19). In <i>c.</i> 513 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Cleisthenes invaded Attica, but was
defeated by the tyrant&rsquo;s mercenaries at Leipsydrium (S. of Mt.
Parnes). Sparta then, in tardy obedience to the oracle, threw
off her alliance with the Peisistratids, and, after one failure,
expelled Hippias in 511-510 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, leaving Athens once again at
the mercy of the powerful families.</p>

<p>Cleisthenes, on his return, was in a difficulty; he realized
that Athens would not tolerate a new tyranny, nor were the
other nobles willing to accept him as leader of a
constitutional oligarchy. It was left for him to &ldquo;take
<span class="sidenote">Home and foreign policy.</span>
the people into partnership&rdquo; as Peisistratus had in a
different way done before him. Solon&rsquo;s reforms had
failed, primarily because they left unimpaired the power of the
great landed nobles, who, in their several districts, doubled the
rôles of landlord, priest and patriarch. This evil of local influence
Peisistratus had concealed by satisfying the nominally sovereign
people that in him they had a sufficient representative. It was
left to Cleisthenes to adopt the remaining remedy of giving
substance to the form of the Solonian constitution. His first
attempts roused the aristocrats to a last effort; Isagoras
appealed to the Spartans (who, though they disliked tyranny,
had no love for democracy) to come to his aid. Cleisthenes
retired on the arrival of a herald from Cleomenes, reviving the
old question of the curse; Isagoras thus became all-powerful<a name="FnAnchor_1p" id="FnAnchor_1p" href="#Footnote_1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
and expelled seven hundred families. The democrats, however,
rose, and after besieging Cleomenes and Isagoras in the Acropolis,
let them go under a safe-conduct, and brought back the exiles.</p>

<p>Apart from the reforms which Cleisthenes was now able to
establish, the period of his ascendancy is a blank, nor are we
told when and how it came to an end. It is clear, however&mdash;and
it is impossible in connexion with the Pan-hellenic patriotism
to which Athens laid claim, to overrate the importance of the
fact&mdash;that Cleisthenes, hard pressed in the war with Boeotia,
Euboea and Sparta (Herod, v. 73 and foll.), sent ambassadors
to ask the help of Persia. The story, as told by Herodotus, that
the ambassadors of their own accord agreed to give &ldquo;earth and
water&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> submission) in return for Persian assistance, and
that the Ecclesia subsequently disavowed their action as unauthorized,
is scarcely credible. Cleisthenes (1) was in full
control and must have instructed the ambassadors; (2) he
knew that any help from Persia meant submission. It is practically
certain, therefore, that he (cf. the Alcmaeonids and the
story of the shield at Marathon) was the first to &ldquo;medize&rdquo;
(see Curtius, <i>History of Greece</i>). Probably he had hoped to
persuade the Ecclesia that the agreement was a mere form.
Aelian says that he himself was a victim to his own device of
ostracism (<i>q.v.</i>); this, though apparently inconsistent with the
<i>Constitution of Athens</i> (<i>c.</i> 22), may perhaps indicate that his
political career ended in disgrace, a hypothesis which is explicable
on the ground of this act of treachery in respect of the attempted
Persian alliance. Whether to Cleisthenes are due the final
success over Boeotia and Euboea, the planting of the 4000
cleruchs on the Lelantine Plain, and the policy of the Aeginetan
War (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aegina</a></span>), in which Athens borrowed ships from Corinth,
it is impossible to determine. The eclipse of Cleisthenes in all
records is one of the most curious facts in Greek history. It is
also curious that we do not know in what official capacity
Cleisthenes carried his reforms. Perhaps he was given extraordinary
<i>ad hoc</i> powers for a specified time; conceivably he
used the ordinary mechanism. It seems clear that he had fully
considered his scheme in advance, that he broached it before
the last attack of Isagoras, and that it was only after the final
expulsion of Isagoras and his Spartan allies that it became
possible for him to put it into execution.</p>

<p>Cleisthenes aimed at being the leader of a self-governing
people; in other words he aimed at making the democracy
actual. He realized that the dead-weight which
held the democracy down was the influence on politics
<span class="sidenote">Analysis of his reforms</span>
of the local religious unit. Therefore his prime object
was to dissociate the clans and the phratries from
politics, and to give the democracy a totally new electoral basis
in which old associations and vested interests would be split
up and become ineffective. It was necessary that no man
should govern a pocket-constituency merely by virtue of his
religious, financial or ancestral prestige, and that there should
be created a new local unit with administrative powers of a
democratic character which would galvanize the lethargic voters
into a new sense of responsibility and independence. His first
step was to abolish the four Solonian tribes and create ten new
ones.<a name="FnAnchor_2p" id="FnAnchor_2p" href="#Footnote_2p"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Each of the new tribes was subdivided into &ldquo;demes&rsquo;&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">The ten tribes</span>
(roughly &ldquo;townships&rdquo;); this organization did not,
except politically, supersede the system of clans and
phratries whose old religious signification remained
untouched. The new tribes, however, though geographically
arranged, did not represent local interests. Further, the tribe
names were taken from legendary heroes (Cecropis, Pandionis,
Aegeis recalled the storied kings of Attica), and, therefore,
contributed to the idea of a national unity; even Ajax, the
eponym of the tribe Aeantis, though not Attic, was famous
as an ally (Herod, v. 66) and ranked as a national hero. Each
tribe had its shrine and its particular hero-cult, which, however,
was free from local association and the dominance of particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>
families. This national idea Cleisthenes further emphasized by
setting up in the market-place at Athens a statue of each tribal
hero.</p>

<p>The next step was the organization of the deme. Within
each tribe he grouped ten demes (see below), each of which had
(1) its hero and its chapel, and (2) its census-list kept
by the demarch. The demarch (local governor), who
<span class="sidenote">Demes.</span>
was elected popularly and held office for one year, presided over
meetings affecting local administration and the provision of
crews for the state-navy, and was probably under a system of
scrutiny like the <i>dokimasia</i> of the state-magistrates. According
to the Aristotelian <i>Constitution of Athens</i>, Cleisthenes further
divided Attica into three districts, Urban and Suburban, Inland
(<i>Mesogaios</i>), and Maritime (<i>Paralia</i>), each of which was subdivided
into ten <i>trittyes</i>; each tribe had three trittyes in each
of these districts. The problem of establishing this decimal
system in connexion with the demes and trittyes is insoluble.
Herodotus says that there were ten<a name="FnAnchor_3p" id="FnAnchor_3p" href="#Footnote_3p"><span class="sp">3</span></a> demes to each tribe
(<span class="grk" title="deka eis tas phylas">&#948;&#941;&#954;&#945; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#940;&#962;</span>); but each tribe was composed of three trittyes,
one in each of the three districts. Since the deme was, as will
be seen, the electoral unit, it is clear that in tribal voting the
object of ending the old threefold schism of the Plain, the Hill
and the Shore was attained, but the relation of deme and trittys
is obviously of an unsymmetrical kind. The <i>Constitution of
Athens</i> says nothing of the ten-deme-to-each-tribe arrangement,
and there is no sufficient reason for supposing that the demes
originally were exactly a hundred in number. We know the
names of 168 demes, and Polemon (3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) enumerated
173. It has been suggested that the demes did originally number
exactly a hundred, and that new demes were added as the population
increased. This theory, however, presupposes that the
demes were originally equal in numbers. In the 5th and 4th
centuries this was certainly not the case; the number of demesmen
in some cases was only one hundred or two hundred,
whereas the deme Acharnae is referred to as a &ldquo;great part&rdquo; of
the whole state, and is known to have furnished three thousand
hoplites. The theory is fundamentally at fault, inasmuch as
it regards the deme as consisting of all those <i>resident within
its borders</i>. In point of fact membership was hereditary, not
residential; Demosthenes &ldquo;of the Paeanian deme&rdquo; might live
where he would without severing his deme connexion. Thus
the increase of population could be no reason for creating new
demes. This distinction in a deme between demesmen and
residents belonging to another deme (the <span class="grk" title="egkektêmenoi">&#7952;&#947;&#954;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>), who
paid a deme-tax for their privilege, is an important one. It
should further be noted that the demes belonging to a particular
tribe do not, as a fact, appear always in three separate groups;
the tribe Aeantis consisted of Phalerum and eleven demes in
the district of Marathon; other tribes had demes in five or six
groups. It must, therefore, be admitted that the problem is
insoluble for want of data. Nor are we better equipped to settle
the relation between the Cleisthenean division into Urban,
Maritime and Inland, and the old divisions of the Plain, the
Shore and the Upland or Hill. The &ldquo;Maritime&rdquo; of Cleisthenes
and the old &ldquo;Shore&rdquo; are certainly not coincident, nor is the
&ldquo;Inland&rdquo; identical with the &ldquo;Upland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lastly, it has been asked whether we are to believe that
Cleisthenes invented the demes. To this the answer is in the
negative. The demes were undoubtedly primitive divisions of
Attica; Herodotus (ix. 73) speaks of the Dioscuri as ravaging
the demes of Decelea (see R.W. Macan <i>ad loc.</i>) and we hear of
opposition between the city and the demes. The most logical
conclusion perhaps is that Cleisthenes, while he <i>did</i> create the
demes which Athens itself comprised, did not create the country
demes, but merely gave them definition as political divisions.
Thus the city itself had six demes in five different tribes, and the
other five tribes were represented in the suburbs and the Peiraeus.
It is clear that in the Cleisthenean system there was one great
source of danger, namely that the residents in and about Athens
must always have had more weight in elections than those in
distant demes. There can be little doubt that the preponderating
influence of the city was responsible for the unwisdom of
the later imperial policy and the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>A second problem is the franchise reform of Cleisthenes.
Aristotle in the <i>Politics</i> (iii. 2. 3 = 1275 b) says that Cleisthenes
created new citizens by enrolling in the tribes &ldquo;many resident
aliens and emancipated slaves.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4p" id="FnAnchor_4p" href="#Footnote_4p"><span class="sp">4</span></a> But the Aristotelian <i>Constitution
of Athens</i> asserts that he gave &ldquo;citizenship to the
masses.&rdquo; These two statements are not compatible. It is
<span class="sidenote">The diapsephismus.</span>
perfectly clear that Cleisthenes is to be regarded as a
democrat, and it would have been no bribe to the
people merely to confer a boon on aliens and slaves.
Moreover, a revision of the citizen-roll (<i>diapsephismus</i>) had
recently taken place (after the end of the tyranny) and a
great many citizens had been struck off the roll as being of
impure descent (<span class="grk" title="oi tô genei mê katharoi">
&#959;&#7985; &#964;&#8183; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#943;</span>). This class had existed
from the time of Solon, and, through fear of political extinction
by the oligarchs, had been favourable to Peisistratus. Cleisthenes
may have enfranchised aliens and slaves, but it seems
certain that he must have dealt with these free Athenians who
had lost their rights. Now Isagoras presumably did not carry
out this revision of the roll (<i>diapsephismus</i>); as &ldquo;the friend of
the tyrants&rdquo; (so <i>Ath. Pol.</i> 20; by Meyer, Busolt and others
contest this) he would not have struck a blow at a class which
favoured his own views. A reasonable hypothesis is that
Cleisthenes was the originator of the measure of expulsion, and
that he now changed his policy, and strengthened his hold on
the democracy by reinstating the disfranchised in much larger
numbers. The new citizens, whoever they were, must, of course,
have been enrolled also in the (hitherto exclusive) phratry lists
and the deme-rolls.</p>

<p>The Boul&#275; (<i>q.v.</i>) was reorganized to suit the new tribal arrangement,
and was known henceforward as the Council of the Five
Hundred, fifty from each tribe. Its exact constitution
is unknown, but it was certainly more democratic
<span class="sidenote">The council and boards of ten.</span>
than the Solonian Four Hundred. Further, the
system of ten tribes led in course of time to the construction
of boards of ten to deal with military and civil affairs,
<i>e.g.</i> the Strategi (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Strategus</a></span>), the Apodectae, and others.
Of these the former cannot be attributed to Cleisthenes, but on
the evidence of Androtion it is certain that it was Cleisthenes
who replaced the Colacretae<a name="FnAnchor_5p" id="FnAnchor_5p" href="#Footnote_5p"><span class="sp">5</span></a> by the Apodectae (&ldquo;receivers&rdquo;),
who were controllers and auditors of the finance department,
and, before the council in the council-chamber, received the
revenues. The Colacretae, who had done this work before,
remained in authority over the internal expenses of the Prytaneum.
A further change which followed from the new tribal
system was the reconstitution of the army; this, however,
probably took place about 501 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and cannot be attributed
directly to Cleisthenes. It has been said that the deme became
the local political unit, replacing the naucrary (<i>q.v.</i>). But the
naucraries still supplied the fleet, and were increased in number
from forty-eight to fifty; if each naucrary still supplied a ship
and two mounted soldiers as before, it is interesting to learn
that, only seventy years before the Peloponnesian War, Athens
had but fifty ships and a hundred horse.<a name="FnAnchor_6p" id="FnAnchor_6p" href="#Footnote_6p"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>The device of ostracism is the final stone in the Cleisthenean
structure. An admirable scheme in theory, and, at first, in
practice, it deteriorated in the 5th century into a mere party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>481</span>
weapon, and in the case of Hyperbolus (417) became an
absurdity.</p>

<p>In conclusion it should be noticed that Cleisthenes was
the founder of the Athens which we know. To him was due
the spirit of nationality, the principle of liberty duly
apportioned and controlled by centralized and decentralized
<span class="sidenote">Summary.</span>
administration, which prepared the ground for the
rich developments of the Golden Age with its triumphs of art
and literature, politics and philosophy. It was Cleisthenes who
organized the structure which, for a long time, bore the heavy
burden of the Empire against impossible odds, the structure
which the very different genius of Pericles was able to beautify.
He was the first to appreciate the unique power in politics,
literature and society of an organized public opinion.</p>

<p class="pt2">2. <span class="sc">Cleisthenes of Sicyon</span> (c. 600-570), grandfather of the
above, became tyrant of Sicyon as the representative of the
conquered Ionian section of the inhabitants. He emphasized
the destruction of Dorian predominance by giving ridiculous
epithets to their tribal units, which from Hylleis, Dymanes and
Pamphyli become Hyatae (&ldquo;Swine-men&rdquo;), Choireatae (&ldquo;Pig-men&rdquo;)
and Oneatae (&ldquo;Ass-men&rdquo;). He also attacked Dorian
Argos, and suppressed the Homeric &ldquo;rhapsodists&rdquo; who sang
the exploits of Dorian heroes. He championed the cause of the
Delphic oracle against the town of Crisa (Cirrha) in the Sacred
War (c. 590). Crisa was destroyed, and Delphi became one of the
meeting-places of the old amphictyony of Anthela, henceforward
often called the Delphic amphictyony. The Pythian games,
largely on the initiative of Cleisthenes, were re-established with
new magnificence, and Cleisthenes won the first chariot race in
582. He founded Pythian games at Sicyon, and possibly built
a new Sicyonian treasury at Delphi. His power was so great
that when he offered his daughter Agariste in marriage, some
of the most prominent Greeks sought the honour, which fell upon
Megacles, the Alcmaeonid. The story of the rival wooers with
the famous retort, &ldquo;Hippocleides don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; is told in Herod.

<p><span class="bold">CLEITOR<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Clitor</span>, a town of ancient Greece, in that part of
Arcadia which corresponds to the modern eparchy of Kalavryta
in the nomos of Elis and Achaea. It stood in a fertile plain to
the south of Mt Chelmos, the highest peak of the Aroanian
Mountains, and not far from a stream of its own name, which
joined the Aroanius, or Katzana. In the neighbourhood was
a fountain, the waters of which were said to deprive those who
drank them of the taste for wine. The town was a place of considerable
importance in Arcadia, and its inhabitants were noted
for their love of liberty. It extended its territory over several
neighbouring towns, and in the Theban war fought against
Orchomenus. It joined the other Arcadian cities in the foundation
of Megalopolis. As a member of the Achaean league it
was besieged by the Aetolians in 220 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and was on several
occasions the seat of the federal assemblies. It coined money
up to the time of Septimius Severus. The ruins, which bear
the common name of Paleopoli, or Old City, are still to be seen
about 3 m. from a village that preserves the ancient designation.
The greater part of the walls which enclose an area of about a
mile and several of the semi-circular towers with which they
were strengthened can be clearly made out; and there are also
remains of three Doric temples and a small theatre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLELAND, WILLIAM<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (1661?-1689), Scottish poet and
soldier, son of Thomas Cleland, gamekeeper to the marquis of
Douglas, was born about 1661. He was probably brought up
on the marquess of Douglas&rsquo;s estate in Lanarkshire, and was
educated at St Andrews University. Immediately on leaving
college he joined the army of the Covenanters, and was present
at Drumclog, where, says Robert Wodrow, some attributed to
Cleland the man&oelig;uvre which led to the victory. He also fought
at Bothwell Bridge. He and his brother James were described
in a royal proclamation of the 16th of June 1679 among the
leaders of the insurgents. He escaped to Holland, but in 1685
was again in Scotland in connexion with the abortive invasion
of the earl of Argyll. He escaped once more, to return in 1688
as agent for William of Orange. He was appointed lieutenant-colonel
of the Cameronian regiment raised from the minority
of the western Covenanters who consented to serve under William
III. The Cameronians were entrusted with the defence of Dunkeld,
which they held against the fierce assault of the Highlanders
on the 26th of August. The repulse of the Highlanders before
Dunkeld ended the Jacobite rising, but Cleland fell in the struggle.
He wrote <i>A Collection of several Poems and Verses</i> composed
upon various occasions (published posthumously, 1697). Of
&ldquo;Hullo, my fancie, whither wilt thou go?&rdquo; only the last nine
stanzas are by Cleland. His poems have small literary merit,
and are written, not in pure Lowland Scots, but in English with
a large admixture of Scottish words. The longest and most
important of them are the &ldquo;mock poems&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Expedition
of the Highland Host who came to destroy the western shires
in winter 1678&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the clergie when they met to consult
about taking the Test in the year 1681.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEMATIS<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span>, in botany, a genus of the natural order Ranunculaceae,
containing nearly two hundred species, and widely
distributed. It is represented in England by <i>Clematis Vitalba</i>,
&ldquo;old man&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; or &ldquo;traveller&rsquo;s joy,&rdquo; a common plant on
chalky or light soil. The plants are shrubby climbers with generally
compound opposite leaves, the stalk of which is sensitive
to contact like a tendril, becoming twisted round suitable objects
and thereby giving support to the plant. The flowers are arranged
in axillary or terminal clusters; they have no petals, but white
or coloured, often very large sepals, and an indefinite number
of stamens and carpels. They contain no honey, and are visited
by insects for the sake of the pollen, which is plentiful. The fruit
is a head of achenes, each bearing the long-bearded persistent
style, suggesting the popular name. This feathery style is an
important agent in the distribution of the seed by means of the
wind. Several of the species, especially the large-flowered ones,
are favourite garden plants, well adapted for covering trellises
or walls, or trailing over the ground. Many garden forms have
been produced by hybridization; among the best known is
<i>C. Jackmanni</i>, due to Mr George Jackman of Woking.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLEMENCEAU, GEORGES<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), French statesman,
was born at Mouilleron-en-Pareds, Vendée, on the 28th of
September 1841. Having adopted medicine as his profession,
he settled in 1869 in Montmartre; and after the revolution of
1870 he had become sufficiently well known to be nominated
mayor of the 18th arrondissement of Paris (Montmartre)&mdash;an
unruly district over which it was a difficult task to preside.
On the 8th of February 1871 he was elected as a Radical to the
National Assembly for the department of the Seine, and voted
against the peace preliminaries. The execution, or rather
murder, of Generals Lecomte and Clément Thomas by the
communists on 18th March, which he vainly tried to prevent,
brought him into collision with the central committee sitting
at the hôtel de ville, and they ordered his arrest, but he escaped;
he was accused, however, by various witnesses, at the subsequent
trial of the murderers (November 29th), of not having intervened
when he might have done, and though he was cleared of this
charge it led to a duel, for his share in which he was prosecuted
and sentenced to a fine and a fortnight&rsquo;s imprisonment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 20th of March 1871, he had introduced
in the National Assembly at Versailles, on behalf of his Radical
colleagues, the bill establishing a Paris municipal council of
eighty members; but he was not returned himself at the elections
of the 26th of March. He tried with the other Paris mayors to
mediate between Versailles and the hôtel de ville, but failed,
and accordingly resigned his mayoralty and his seat in the
Assembly, and temporarily gave up politics; but he was elected
to the Paris municipal council on the 23rd of July 1871 for the
Clignancourt <i>quartier</i>, and retained his seat till 1876, passing
through the offices of secretary and vice-president, and becoming
president in 1875. In 1876 he stood again for the Chamber of
Deputies, and was elected for the 18th arrondissement. He joined
the Extreme Left, and his energy and mordant eloquence
speedily made him the leader of the Radical section. In 1877,
after the <i>Seize Mai</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>), he was one of the
republican majority who denounced the Broglie ministry, and
he took a leading part in resisting the anti-republican policy
of which the <i>Seize Mai</i> incident was a symptom, his demand
in 1879 for the indictment of the Broglie ministry bringing him
into particular prominence. In 1880 he started his newspaper,
<i>La Justice</i>, which became the principal organ of Parisian Radicalism;
and from this time onwards throughout M. Grévy&rsquo;s
presidency his reputation as a political critic, and as a destroyer
of ministries who yet would not take office himself, rapidly grew.
He led the Extreme Left in the Chamber. He was an active
opponent of M. Jules Ferry&rsquo;s colonial policy and of the Opportunist
party, and in 1885 it was his use of the Tongking disaster
which principally determined the fall of the Ferry cabinet.
At the elections of 1885 he advocated a strong Radical programme,
and was returned both for his old seat in Paris and for
the Var, selecting the latter. Refusing to form a ministry to
replace the one he had overthrown, he supported the Right in
keeping M. Freycinet in power in 1886, and was responsible
for the inclusion of General Boulanger in the Freycinet cabinet
as war minister. When Boulanger (<i>q.v.</i>) showed himself as an
ambitious pretender, Clemenceau withdrew his support and
became a vigorous combatant against the Boulangist movement,
though the Radical press and a section of the party continued
to patronize the general.</p>

<p>By his exposure of the Wilson scandal, and by his personal
plain speaking, M. Clemenceau contributed largely to M. Grévy&rsquo;s
resignation of the presidency in 1887, having himself declined
Grévy&rsquo;s request to form a cabinet on the downfall of that of
M. Rouvier; and he was primarily responsible, by advising
his followers to vote neither for Floquet, Ferry nor Freycinet,
for the election of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; as president in M. Carnot.
He had arrived, however, at the height of his influence, and
several factors now contributed to his decline. The split in the
Radical party over Boulangism weakened his hands, and its
collapse made his help unnecessary to the moderate republicans.
A further misfortune occurred in the Panama affair, Clemenceau&rsquo;s
relations with Cornelius Herz leading to his being involved
in the general suspicion; and, though he remained the leading
spokesman of French Radicalism, his hostility to the Russian
alliance so increased his unpopularity that in the election for
1893 he was defeated for the Chamber, after having sat in it
continuously since 1876. After his defeat for the Chamber,
M. Clemenceau confined his political activities to journalism,
his career being further overclouded&mdash;so far as any immediate
possibility of regaining his old ascendancy was concerned&mdash;by
the long-drawn-out Dreyfus case, in which he took an active
and honourable part as a supporter of M. Zola and an opponent
of the anti-Semitic and Nationalist campaign. In 1900 he
withdrew from <i>La Justice</i> to found a weekly review, <i>Le Bloc</i>,
which lasted until March 1902. On the 6th of April 1902 he
was elected senator for the Var, although he had previously
continually demanded the suppression of the Senate. He sat
with the Socialist Radicals, and vigorously supported the
Combes ministry. In June 1903 he undertook the direction of
the journal <i>L&rsquo;Aurore</i>, which he had founded. In it he led the
campaign for the revision of the Dreyfus affair, and for the
separation of Church and State.</p>

<p>In March 1906 the fall of the Rouvier ministry, owing to the
riots provoked by the inventories of church property, at last
brought Clemenceau to power as minister of the interior in the
Sarrien cabinet. The strike of miners in the Pas de Calais
after the disaster at Courrières, leading to the threat of disorder
on the 1st of May 1906, obliged him to employ the military;
and his attitude in the matter alienated the Socialist party,
from which he definitely broke in his notable reply in the Chamber
to Jean Jaurès in June 1906. This speech marked him out as
the strong man of the day in French politics; and when the
Sarrien ministry resigned in October, he became premier. During
1907 and 1908 his premiership was notable for the way in which
the new <i>entente</i> with England was cemented, and for the successful
part which France played in European politics, in spite of difficulties
with Germany and attacks by the Socialist party in
connexion with Morocco (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>). But on July
20th, 1909, he was defeated in a discussion in the Chamber on
the state of the navy, in which bitter words were exchanged
between him and Delcassé; and he at once resigned, being
succeeded as premier by M. Briand, with a reconstructed
cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEMENCÍN, DIEGO<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (1765-1834), Spanish scholar and
politician, was born on the 27th of September 1765, at Murcia,
and was educated there at the Colegio de San Fulgencio.
Abandoning his intention of taking orders, he found employment
at Madrid in 1788 as tutor to the sons of the countess-duchess
de Benavente, and devoted himself to the study of archaeology.
In 1807 he became editor of the <i>Gaceta de Madrid</i>, and in the
following year was condemned to death by Murat for publishing
a patriotic article; he fled to Cadiz, and under the Junta Central
held various posts from which he was dismissed by the reactionary
government of 1814. During the liberal régime of
1820-1823 Clemencín took office as colonial minister, was exiled
till 1827, and in 1833 published the first volume of his edition
(1833-1839) of <i>Don Quixote</i>. Its merits were recognized by his
appointment as royal librarian, but he did not long enjoy his
triumph: he died on the 30th of July 1834. His commentary
on <i>Don Quixote</i> owes something to John Bowle, and is disfigured
by a patronizing, carping spirit; nevertheless it is the most
valuable work of its kind, and is still unsuperseded. Clemencín
is also the author of an interesting <i>Elogio de la reina Isabel la
Católica</i>, published as the sixth volume of the <i>Memorias</i> of the
Spanish Academy of History, to which body he was elected
on the 12th of September 1800.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLEMENT<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Clemens</i>, <i>i.e.</i> merciful; Gr. <span class="grk" title="Klêmes">&#922;&#955;&#942;&#956;&#951;&#962;</span>), the
name of fourteen popes and two anti-popes.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> I., generally known as Clement of Rome, or <span class="sc">Clemens
Romanus</span> (flor. c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 96), was one of the &ldquo;Apostolic Fathers,&rdquo;
and in the lists of bishops of Rome is given the third or fourth
place&mdash;Peter, Linus, (Anencletus), Clement. There is no ground
for identifying him with the Clement of Phil. iv. 3. He may
have been a freedman of T. Flavius Clemens, who was consul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>483</span>
with his cousin, the Emperor Domitian, in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 95. A 9th-
century tradition says he was martyred in the Crimea in 102;
earlier authorities say he died a natural death; he is commemorated
on the 23rd of November.</p>

<p>In <i>The Shepherd of Hermas</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) (Vis. 11. iv. 3) mention is
made of one Clement whose office it is to communicate with other
churches, and this function agrees well with what we find in
the letter to the church at Corinth by which Clement is best
known. Whilst being on our guard against reading later ideas
into the title &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; as applied to Clement, there is no reason
to doubt that he was one of the chief personalities in the Christian
community at Rome, where since the time of Paul the separate
house congregations (Rom. xvi.) had been united into one
church officered by presbyters and deacons (Clem. 40-42).
The letter in question was occasioned by a dispute in the church
of Corinth, which had led to the ejection of several presbyters
from their office. It does not contain Clement&rsquo;s name, but is
addressed by &ldquo;the Church of God which sojourneth in Rome to
the Church of God which sojourneth in Corinth.&rdquo; But there is
no reason for doubting the universal tradition which ascribes
it to Clement, or the generally accepted date, c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 96. No
claim is made by the Roman Church to interfere on any ground
of superior rank; yet it is noteworthy that in the earliest
document outside the canon which we can securely date, the
church in the imperial city comes forward as a peacemaker to
compose the troubles of a church in Greece. Nothing is known
of the cause of the discontent; no moral offence is charged
against the presbyters, and their dismissal is regarded by
Clement as high-handed and unjustifiable, and as a revolt of
the younger members of the community against the elder.
After a laudatory account of the past conduct of the Corinthian
Church, he enters upon a denunciation of vices and a praise of
virtues, and illustrates his various topics by copious citations
from the Old Testament scriptures. Thus he paves the way
for his tardy rebuke of present disorders, which he reserves until
two-thirds of his epistle is completed. Clement is exceedingly
discursive, and his letter reaches twice the length of the Epistle
to the Hebrews. Many of his general exhortations are but very
indirectly connected with the practical issue to which the epistle
is directed, and it is very probable that he was drawing largely
upon the homiletical material with which he was accustomed to
edify his fellow-Christians at Rome.</p>

<p>This view receives some support from the long liturgical
prayer at the close, which almost certainly represents the
intercession used in the Roman eucharists. But we must not
allow such a theory to blind us to the true wisdom with which
the writer defers his censure. He knows that the roots of the
quarrel lie in a wrong condition of the church&rsquo;s life. His general
exhortations, courteously expressed in the first person plural,
are directed towards a wide reformation of manners. If the
wrong spirit can be exorcised, there is hope that the quarrel will
end in a general desire for reconciliation. The most permanent
interest of the epistle lies in the conception of the grounds on
which the Christian ministry rests according to the view of a
prominent teacher before the 1st century has closed. The
orderliness of nature is appealed to as expressing the mind of its
Creator. The orderliness of Old Testament worship bears a like
witness; everything is duly fixed by God; high priests, priests
and Levites, and the people in the people&rsquo;s place. Similarly
in the Christian dispensation all is in order due. &ldquo;The apostles
preached the gospel to us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus
Christ was sent from God. Christ then is from God, and the
apostles from Christ. . . . They appointed their first-fruits,
having tested them by the Spirit, as bishops and deacons of those
who should believe. . . . Our apostles knew through our Lord
Jesus Christ that there would be strife about the name of the
bishop&rsquo;s office. For this cause therefore, having received
perfect foreknowledge, they appointed the aforesaid, and afterwards
gave a further injunction (<span class="grk" title="heptnomên">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#942;&#957;</span>] has now the further
evidence of the Latin <i>legem</i>) that, if these should fall asleep,
other approved men should succeed to their ministry. . . .
It will be no small sin in us if we eject from the bishop&rsquo;s
office those who have offered the gifts blamelessly and holily&rdquo;
(cc. xlii. xliv.).</p>

<p>Clement&rsquo;s familiarity with the Old Testament points to his
being a Christian of long standing rather than a recent convert.
We learn from his letter (i. 7) that the church at Rome, though
suffering persecution, was firmly held together by faith and love,
and was exhibiting its unity in an orderly worship. The epistle
was publicly read from time to time at Corinth, and by the 4th
century this usage had spread to other churches. We even find
it attached to the famous Alexandrian MS. (Codex A) of the New
Testament, but this does not imply that it ever reached canonical
rank. For the mass of early Christian literature that was gradually
attached to his name see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Clementine Literature</a></span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The epistle was published in 1633 by Patrick Young from Cod.
Alexandrinus, in which a leaf near the end was missing, so that
the great prayer (cc. lv.-lxiv.) remained unknown. In 1875 (six
years after J.B. Lightfoot&rsquo;s first edition) Bryennius (<i>q.v.</i>) published
a complete text from the MS. in Constantinople (dated 1055), from
which in 1883 he gave us the <i>Didaché</i>. In 1876 R.L. Bensly found a
complete Syriac text in a MS. recently obtained by the University
library at Cambridge. Lightfoot made use of these new materials
in an Appendix (1877); his second edition, on which he had been
at work at the time of his death, came out in 1890. This must
remain the standard edition, notwithstanding Dom Morin&rsquo;s most
interesting discovery of a Latin version (1894), which was probably
made in the 3rd century, and is a valuable addition to the
authorities for the text. Its evidence is used in a small edition of
the epistle by R. Knopf (Leipzig, 1899). See also W. Wrede, <i>Untersuchungen zum ersten
Clemensbrief</i> (1891), and the other literature cited

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> II. (Suidger) became pope on the 25th of December

and chancellor to the emperor Henry III., to whom he was
indebted for his elevation to the papacy upon the abdication
of Gregory VI. He was the first pope placed on the throne by
the power of the German emperors, but his short pontificate was
only signalized by the convocation of a council in which decrees
were enacted against simony. He died on the 9th of October

at Pisa to succeed Gregory VIII. On the 31st of May 1188 he
concluded a treaty with the Romans which removed difficulties
of long standing, and in April 1189 he made peace with the emperor
Frederick I. Barbarossa. He settled a controversy with William
of Scotland concerning the choice of the archbishop of St Andrews,
and on the 13th of March 1188 removed the Scottish church from
under the legatine jurisdiction of the archbishop of York, thus
making it independent of all save Rome. In spite of his conciliatory
policy, Clement angered Henry VI. of Germany by
bestowing Sicily on Tancred. The crisis was acute when the
pope died, probably in the latter part of March 1191.</p>

He studied law, and became a valued adviser of Louis IX. of
France. He married, and was the father of two daughters, but
after the death of his wife took orders. In 1257 he became
bishop of Le Puy; in 1259 he was elected archbishop of Narbonne;
and on the 24th of December 1261 Urban IV. created
him cardinal bishop of Sabina. He was appointed legate in
England on the 22nd of November 1263, and before his return
was elected pope at Perugia on the 5th of February 1265. On
the 26th of February he invested Charles of Anjou with the
kingdom of Sicily; but subsequently he came into conflict with
Charles, especially after the death of Manfred in February 1266.
To the cruelty and avarice of Charles he opposed a generous
humanity. When Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen,
appeared in Italy the pope excommunicated him and his supporters,
but it is improbable that he was in the remotest degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>484</span>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> V. (Bertrand de Gouth), pope from 1305 to 1314, was
born of a noble Gascon family about 1264. After studying the
arts at Toulouse and law at Orleans and Bologna, he became
a canon at Bordeaux and then vicar-general to his brother the
archbishop of Lyons, who in 1294 was created cardinal bishop
of Albano. Bertrand was made a chaplain to Boniface VIII.,
who in 1295 nominated him bishop of Cominges (Haute Garonne),
and in 1299 translated him to the archbishopric of Bordeaux.
Because he attended the synod at Rome in 1302 in the controversy
between France and the Pope, he was considered a
supporter of Boniface VIII., yet was by no means unfavourably
regarded at the French court. At Perugia on the 5th of June
1305 he was chosen to succeed Benedict XI; the cardinals
by a vote of ten to five electing one neither an Italian nor a
cardinal, in order to end a conclave which had lasted eleven
months. The chronicler Villani relates that Bertrand owed his
election to a secret agreement with Philip IV., made at St Jean
d&rsquo;Angély in Saintonge; this may be dismissed as gossip, but
it is probable that the future pope had to accept certain conditions
laid down by the cardinals. At Bordeaux Bertrand was
formally notified of his election and urged to come to Italy;
but he caused his coronation to take place at Lyons on the 14th
of November 1305. From the beginning Clement V. was subservient
to French interests. Among his first acts was the
creation of nine French cardinals. Early in 1306 he modified
or explained away those features of the bulls <i>Clericis Laicos</i>
and <i>Unam sanctam</i> which were particularly offensive to the
king. Most of the year 1306 he spent at Bordeaux because of
ill-health; subsequently he resided at Poitiers and elsewhere,
and in March 1309 the entire papal court settled at Avignon,
an imperial fief held by the king of Sicily. Thus began the
seventy years &ldquo;Babylonian captivity of the Church.&rdquo; On the
13th of October 1307 came the arrest of all the Knights Templar
in France, the breaking of a storm conjured up by royal jealousy
and greed. From the very day of Clement&rsquo;s coronation the
king had charged the Templars with heresy, immorality and
abuses, and the scruples of the weak pope were at length overcome
by apprehension lest the State should not wait for the
Church, but should proceed independently against the alleged
heretics, as well as by the royal threats of pressing the accusation
of heresy against the late Boniface VIII. In pursuance of the
king&rsquo;s wishes Clement summoned the council of Vienne (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vienne, Council of</a></span>), which was unable to conclude that the
Templars were guilty of heresy. The pope abolished the order,
however, as it seemed to be in bad repute and had outlived its
usefulness. Its French estates were granted to the Hospitallers,
but actually Philip IV. held them until his death.</p>

<p>In his relations to the Empire Clement was an opportunist.
He refused to use his full influence in favour of the candidacy
of Charles of Valois, brother of Philip IV., lest France became
too powerful; and recognized Henry of Luxemburg, whom
his representatives crowned emperor at the Lateran in 1312.
When Henry, however, came into conflict with Robert of Naples,
Clement supported Robert and threatened the emperor with
ban and interdict. But the crisis passed with the unexpected
death of Henry, soon followed by that of the pope on the 20th
of April 1314 at Roquemaure-sur-Rhône. Though the sale of
offices and oppressive taxation which disgraced his pontificate
may in part be explained by the desperate condition of the papal
finances and by his saving up gold for a crusade, nevertheless
he indulged in unbecoming pomp. Showing favouritism toward
his family and his nation, he brought untold disaster on the
Church.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> VI. (Pierre Roger), pope from the 7th of May 1342
to the 6th of December 1352, was born at Maumont in Limousin
in 1291, the son of the wealthy lord of Rosières, entered the
Benedictine order as a boy, studied at Paris, and became successively
prior of St Baudil, abbot of Fécamp, bishop of Arras,
chancellor of France, archbishop of Sens and archbishop of
Rouen. He was made cardinal-priest of Sti Nereo ed Achilleo
and administrator of the bishopric of Avignon by Benedict XII.
in 1338, and four years later succeeded him as pope. He continued
to reside at Avignon despite the arguments of envoys
and the verses of Petrarch, but threw a sop to the Romans by
reducing the Jubilee term from one hundred years to fifty. He
appointed Cola di Rienzo to a civil position at Rome, and,
although at first approving the establishment of the tribunate,
he later sent a legate who excommunicated Rienzo and, with
the help of the aristocratic faction, drove him from the city
(December 1347). Clement continued the struggle of his predecessors
with the emperor Louis the Bavarian, excommunicating
him after protracted negotiations on the 13th of April 1346,
and directing the election of Charles of Moravia, who received
general recognition after the death of Louis in October 1347,
and put an end to the schism which had long divided Germany.
Clement proclaimed a crusade in 1343, but nothing was accomplished
beyond a naval attack on Smyrna (29th of October 1344).
He also carried on fruitless negotiations for church unity with
the Armenians and with the Greek emperor, John Cantacuzenus.
He tried to end the Hundred Years&rsquo; War between England and
France, but secured only a temporary truce. He excommunicated
Casimir of Poland for marital infidelity and forced him to
do penance. He successfully resisted encroachments on ecclesiastical
jurisdiction by the kings of England, Castile and Aragon.
He made Prague an archbishopric in 1344, and three years later
founded the university there. During the disastrous plague of
1347-1348 Clement did all he could to alleviate the distress,
and condemned the Flagellants and Jew-baiters. He tried
Queen Joanna of Naples for the murder of her husband and
acquitted her. He secured full ownership of the county of
Avignon through purchase from Queen Joanna (9th of June 1348)
and renunciation of feudal claims by Charles IV. of France, and
considerably enlarged the papal palace in that city. To supply
money for his many undertakings Clement revived the practice
of selling reservations and expectancies, which had been abolished
by his predecessor. Oppressive taxation and unblushing
nepotism were Clement&rsquo;s great faults. On the other hand, he
was famed for his engaging manners, eloquence and theological
learning. He died on the 6th of December 1352, and was buried
in the Benedictine abbey at Auvergne, but his tomb was destroyed
by Calvinists in 1562.    His successor was Innocent VI.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> VII. (Robert of Geneva), (d. 1394), antipope, brother
of Peter, count of Genevois, was connected by blood or marriage
with most of the sovereigns of Europe. After occupying the
episcopal sees of Thérouanne and Cambrai, he attained to the
cardinalate at an early age. In 1377, as legate of Pope Gregory
XI. in the Romagna, he directed, or rather assisted in, the
savage suppression of the revolt of the inhabitants of Cesena
against the papal authority. In the following year he took part
in the election of Pope Urban VI. at Rome, and was perhaps
the first to express doubts as to the validity of that tumultuous
election. After withdrawing to Fondi to reconsider the election,
the cardinals finally resolved to regard Urban as an intruder
and the Holy See as still vacant, and an almost unanimous vote
was given in favour of Robert of Geneva (20th of September
1378), who took the name of Clement VII. Thus originated the
Great Schism of the West.</p>

<p>To his high connexions and his adroitness, as well as to the
gross mistakes of his rival, Clement owed the immediate support
of Queen Joanna of Naples and of several of the Italian barons;
and the king of France, Charles V., who seems to have been
sounded beforehand on the choice of the Roman pontiff, soon
became his warmest protector. Clement eventually succeeded
in winning to his cause Scotland, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, a
great part of the Latin East, and Flanders. He had adherents,
besides, scattered through Germany, while Portugal on two
occasions acknowledged him, but afterwards forsook him.
From Avignon, however, where he had immediately fixed his
residence, his eyes were always turned towards Italy, his purpose
being to wrest Rome from his rival. To attain this end he
lavished his gold&mdash;or rather the gold provided by the clergy in
his obedience&mdash;without stint, and conceived a succession of the
most adventurous projects, of which one at least was to leave a
lasting mark on history.</p>

<p>By the bait of a kingdom to be carved expressly out of the
States of the Church and to be called the kingdom of Adria,
coupled with the expectation of succeeding to Queen Joanna,
Clement incited Louis, duke of Anjou, the eldest of the brothers
of Charles V., to take arms in his favour. These tempting offers
gave rise to a series of expeditions into Italy carried out almost
exclusively at Clement&rsquo;s expense, in the first of which Louis
lost his life. These enterprises on several occasions planted
Angevin domination in the south of the Italian peninsula, and
their most decisive result was the assuring of Provence to the
dukes of Anjou and afterwards to the kings of France. After
the death of Louis, Clement hoped to find equally brave and
interested champions in Louis&rsquo; son and namesake; in Louis of
Orleans, the brother of Charles VI.; in Charles VI. himself;
and in John III., count of Armagnac. The prospect of his
briliant progress to Rome was ever before his eyes; and in his
thoughts force of arms, of French arms, was to be the instrument
of his glorious triumph over his competitor.</p>

<p>There came a time, however, when Clement and more particularly
his following had to acknowledge the vanity of these
illusive dreams; and before his death, which took place on the
16th of September 1394, he realized the impossibility of overcoming
by brute force an opposition which was founded on the
convictions of the greater part of Catholic Europe, and discerned
among his adherents the germs of disaffection. By his vast
expenditure, ascribable not only to his wars in Italy, his incessant
embassies, and the necessity of defending himself in the Comtat
Venaissin against the incursions of the adventurous Raymond
of Turenne, but also to his luxurious tastes and princely habits,
as well as by his persistent refusal to refer the question of the
schism to a council, he incurred general reproach. Unity was
the crying need; and men began to fasten upon him the responsibility
of the hateful schism, not on the score of insincerity&mdash;which
would have been very unjust,&mdash;but by reason of his
obstinate persistence in the course he had chosen.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> VII. (Giulio de&rsquo; Medici), pope from 1523 to 1534,
was the son of Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, assassinated in the conspiracy
of the Pazzi at Florence, and of a certain Fioretta, daughter of
Antonia. Being left an orphan he was taken into his own house
by Lorenzo the Magnificent and educated with his sons. In 1494
Giulio went with them into exile; but, on Giovanni&rsquo;s restoration
to power, returned to Florence, of which he was made
archbishop by his cousin Pope Leo X., a special dispensation
being granted on account of his illegitimate birth, followed by
a formal declaration of the fact that his parents had been secretly
married and that he was therefore legitimate. On the 23rd of
September 1513 the pope conferred on him the title of cardinal
and made him legate at Bologna. During the reign of the
pleasure-loving Leo, Cardinal Giulio had practically the whole
papal government in his hands and displayed all the qualities
of a good administrator; and when, on the death of Adrian VI.&mdash;whose
election he had done most to secure&mdash;he was chosen
pope (Nov. 18, 1523), his accession was hailed as the dawn of a
happier era. It soon became clear, however, that the qualities
which had made Clement an excellent second in command were
not equal to the exigencies of supreme power at a time of peculiar
peril and difficulty.</p>

<p>Though free from the grosser vices of his predecessors, a
man of taste, and economical without being avaricious, Clement
VII. was essentially a man of narrow outlook and interests.
He failed to understand the great spiritual movement which
was convulsing the Church; and instead of bending his mind
to the problem of the Reformation, he from the first subordinated
the cause of Catholicism and of the world to his interests as an
Italian prince and a Medici. Even in these purely secular affairs,
moreover, his timidity and indecision prevented him from
pursuing a consistent policy; and his ill fortune, or his lack of
judgment, placed him, as long as he had the power of choice,
ever on the losing side.</p>

<p>Clement&rsquo;s accession at once brought about a political change
in favour of France; yet he was unable to take a strong line,
and wavered between the emperor and Francis I., concluding
a treaty of alliance with the French king, and then, when the
crushing defeat of Pavia had shown him his mistake, making
his peace with Charles (April 1, 1525), only to break it again
by countenancing Girolamo Morone&rsquo;s League of Freedom, of
which the aim was to assert the independence of Italy from
foreign powers. On the betrayal of this conspiracy Clement
made a fresh submission to the emperor, only to follow this, a
year later, by the Holy League of Cognac with Francis I. (May
22, 1526). Then followed the imperial invasion of Italy and
Bourbon&rsquo;s sack of Rome (May 1527) which ended the Augustan
age of the papal city in a horror of fire and blood. The pope
himself was besieged in the castle of St Angelo, compelled on the
6th of June to ransom himself with a payment of 400,000 scudi,
and kept in confinement until, on the 26th of November, he
accepted the emperor&rsquo;s terms, which besides money payments
included the promise to convene a general council to deal with
Lutheranism. On the 6th of December Clement escaped, before
the day fixed for his liberation, to Orvieto, and at once set to
work to establish peace. After the signature of the treaty of
Cambrai on the 3rd of August 1529 Charles met Clement at
Bologna and received from him the imperial crown and the iron
crown of Lombardy. The pope was now restored to the greater
part of his temporal power; but for some years it was exercised
in subservience to the emperor. During this period Clement was
mainly occupied in urging Charles to arrest the progress of the
Reformation in Germany and in efforts to elude the emperor&rsquo;s
demand for a general council, which Clement feared lest the
question of the mode of his election and his legitimacy should
be raised. It was due to his dependence on Charles V., rather
than to any conscientious scruples, that Clement evaded Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s demand for the nullification of his marriage with Catherine
of Aragon, and so brought about the breach between England
and Rome. Some time before his death, however, the dynastic
interests of his family led him once more to a rapprochement
with France. On the 9th of June 1531 an agreement was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>
signed for the marriage of Henry of Orleans with Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici; but it was not till October 1533 that Clement met
Francis at Marseilles, the wedding being celebrated on the 27th.
Before, however, the new political alliance, thus cemented, could
take effect, Clement died, on the 25th of September 1534.</p>

immediately recognized by Alphonso V. of Aragon, who was
hostile to Pope Martin V. on account of the latter&rsquo;s opposition to
his claims to the kingdom of Naples, but abdicated as soon as an
agreement was reached between Alphonso and Martin through

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> VIII. (Ippolito Aldobrandini), pope from 1592 to
1605, was born at Fano, in 1535. He became a jurist and filled
several important offices. In 1585 he was made a cardinal, and
subsequently discharged a delicate mission to Poland with skill.
His moderation and experience commended him to his fellow
cardinals, and on the 30th of January 1592 he was elected pope, to
succeed Innocent IX. While not hostile to Philip II., Clement
desired to emancipate the papacy from undue Spanish influence,
and to that end cultivated closer relations with France. In 1595
he granted absolution to Henry IV., and so removed the last
objection to the acknowledgment of his legitimacy. The peace of
Vervins (1598), which marked the end of Philip&rsquo;s opposition to
Henry, was mainly the work of the pope. Clement also entertained
hopes of recovering England. He corresponded with
James I. and with his queen, Anne of Denmark, a convert to
Catholicism. But James was only half in earnest, and, besides,
dared not risk a breach with his subjects. Upon the failure of
the line of Este, Clement claimed the reversion of Ferrara and
reincorporated it into the States of the Church (1598). He
remonstrated against the exclusion of the Jesuits from France,
and obtained their readmission. But in their doctrinal controversy
with the Dominicans (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molina, Luis</a></span>) he refrained from
a decision, being unwilling to offend either party. Under Clement
the publication of the revised edition of the Vulgate, begun by
Sixtus V., was finished; the Breviary, Missal and Pontifical
received certain corrections; the Index was expanded; the
Vatican library enlarged; and the Collegium Clementinum
founded. Clement was an unblushing nepotist; three of his
nephews he made cardinals, and to one of them gradually
surrendered the control of affairs. But on the other hand among
those whom he promoted to the cardinalate were such men
as Baronius, Bellarmine and Toledo. During this pontificate
occurred the burning of Giordano Bruno for heresy; and the
tragedy of the Cenci (see the respective articles). Clement died
on the 5th of March 1605, and was succeeded by Leo XI.</p>

an extraordinary education in letters, theology and law, filled
various important offices in the Curia, and finally, on the 23rd of
November 1700, succeeded Innocent XII. as pope. His private
life and his administration were blameless, but it was his misfortune
to reign in troublous times. In the war of the Spanish
Succession he would willingly have remained neutral, but found
himself between two fires, forced first to recognize Philip V., then
driven by the emperor to recognize the Archduke Charles. In
the peace of Utrecht he was ignored; Sardinia and Sicily, Parma
and Piacenza, were disposed of without regard to papal claims.
When he quarrelled with the duke of Savoy, and revoked his
investiture rights in Sicily (1715), his interdict was treated with
contempt. The prestige of the papacy had hardly been lower
within two centuries. About 1702 the Jansenist controversy
broke out afresh. Clement reaffirmed the infallibility of the pope,
in matters of <i>fact</i> (1705), and, in 1713, issued the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>,
condemning 101 Jansenistic propositions extracted from the
<i>Moral Reflections</i> of Pasquier Quesnel. The rejection of this bull
by certain bishops led to a new party division and a further
prolonging of the controversy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jansenism</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quesnel,
Pasquier</a></span>). Clement also forbade the practice of the Jesuit
missionaries in China of &ldquo;accommodating&rdquo; their teachings to
pagan notions or customs, in order to win converts. Clement was
a polished writer, and a generous patron of art and letters. He
died on the 19th of March 1721.</p>

the Two Sicilies and Parma (1764-1768). The order turned
to the pope as its natural protector; but his protests (cf. the
bull <i>Apostolicum pascendi munus</i>, 7th of January 1765) were
unheeded (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jesuits</a></span>). A clash with Parma occurred to aggravate
his troubles. The Bourbon kings espoused their relative&rsquo;s
quarrel, seized Avignon, Benevento and Ponte Corvo, and
united in a peremptory demand for the suppression of the
Jesuits (January 1769). Driven to extremities, Clement consented
to call a Consistory to consider the step, but on the very
eve of the day set for its meeting he died (2nd of February 1769),
not without suspicion of poison, of which, however, there appears
to be no conclusive evidence.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Clement</span> XIV. (Lorenzo Ganganelli), pope from 1769 to 1774,
son of a physician of St Arcangelo, near Rimini, was born on
the 31st of October 1705, entered the Franciscan order at the
age of seventeen, and became a teacher of theology and philosophy.
As regent of the college of S. Bonaventura, Rome, he
came under the notice of Benedict XIV., who conceived a
high opinion of his talents and made him consulter of the Inquisition.
Upon the recommendation of Ricci, general of the Jesuits,
Clement XIII. made him a cardinal; but, owing to his disapproval
of the pope&rsquo;s policy, he found himself out of favour
and without influence. The conclave following the death of
Clement XIII. was the most momentous of at least two centuries.
The fate of the Jesuits hung in the balance; and the Bourbon
princes were determined to have a pope subservient to their
hostile designs. The struggle was prolonged three months.
At length, on the 19th of May 1769, Ganganelli was chosen, not
as a declared enemy of the Jesuits, but as being least objectionable
to each of the contending factions. The charge of simony
was inspired by Jesuit hatred; there is absolutely no evidence
that Ganganelli pledged himself to suppress the order.</p>

<p>The outlook for the papacy was dark; Portugal was talking
of a patriarchate; France held Avignon; Naples held Ponte
Corvo and Benevento; Spain was ill-affected; Parma, defiant;
Venice, aggressive; Poland meditating a restriction of the
rights of the nuncio. Clement realized the imperative necessity
of conciliating the powers. He suspended the public reading
of the bull <i>In Coena Domini</i>, so obnoxious to civil authority;
resumed relations with Portugal; revoked the <i>monitorium</i> of
his predecessor against Parma. But the powers were bent upon
the destruction of the Jesuits, and they had the pope at their
mercy. Clement looked abroad for help, but found none. Even
Maria Theresa, his last hope, suppressed the order in Austria.
Temporizing and partial concessions were of no avail. At last,
convinced that the peace of the Church demanded the sacrifice,
Clement signed the brief <i>Dominus ac Redemptor</i>, dissolving the
order, on the 21st of July 1773. The powers at once gave
substantial proof of their satisfaction; Benevento, Ponte Corvo,
Avignon and the Venaissin were restored to the Holy See.
But it would be unfair to accept this as evidence of a bargain.
Clement had formerly indignantly rejected the suggestion of
such an exchange of favours.</p>

<p>There is no question of the legality of the pope&rsquo;s act; whether
he was morally culpable, however, continues to be a matter of
bitter controversy. On the one hand, the suppression is denounced
as a base surrender to the forces of tyranny and irreligion,
an act of treason to conscience, which reaped its just punishment
of remorse; on the other hand, it is as ardently maintained
that Clement acted in full accord with his conscience, and that
the order merited its fate by its own mischievous activities
which made it an offence to religion and authority alike. But
whatever the guilt or innocence of the Jesuits, and whether their
suppression were ill-advised or not, there appears to be no
ground for impeaching the motives of Clement, or of doubting
that he had the approval of his conscience. The stories of his
having swooned after signing the brief, and of having lost hope
and even reason, are too absurd to be entertained. The decline
in health, which set in shortly after the suppression, and his
death (on the 22nd of September 1774) proceeded from wholly
natural causes. The testimony of his physician and of his
confessor ought to be sufficient to discredit the oft-repeated
story of slow poisoning (see Duhr, <i>Jesuiten Fabeln</i>, 4th ed.,
1904, pp. 69 seq.).</p>

<p>The suppression of the Jesuits bulks so large in the pontificate
of Clement that he has scarcely been given due credit for his
praiseworthy attempt to reduce the burdens of taxation and to
reform the financial administration, nor for his liberal encouragement
of art and learning, of which the museum Pio-Clementino
is a lasting monument.</p>

<p>No pope has been the subject of more diverse judgments than
Clement XIV. Zealous defenders credit him with all virtues,
and bless him as the instrument divinely ordained to restore the
peace of the Church; virulent detractors charge him with
ingratitude, cowardice and double-dealing. The truth is at neither
extreme. Clement&rsquo;s was a deeply religious and poetical nature,
animated by a lofty and refined spirit. Gentleness, equanimity
and benevolence were native to him. He cherished high purposes
and obeyed a lively conscience. But he instinctively shrank
from conflict; he lacked the resoluteness and the sterner sort
of courage that grapples with a crisis.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Caraccioli&rsquo;s <i>Vie de Clément XIV</i> (Paris, 1775) (freq. translated),
is incomplete, uncritical and too laudatory. The middle of the
19th century saw quite a spirited controversy over Clement XIV.;
St Priest, in his <i>Hist. de la chute des Jésuites</i> (Paris, 1846),
represented Clement as lamentably, almost culpably, weak; Cretineau-Joly,
in his <i>Hist. ... de la Comp. de Jésus</i> (Paris, 1844-1845), and his
<i>Clément XIV et les Jésuites</i> (Paris, 1847), was outspoken and bitter
in his condemnation; this provoked Theiner&rsquo;s <i>Gesch. des Pontificats
Clemens&rsquo; XIV.</i> (Leipzig and Paris, 1852), a vigorous defence based
upon original documents to which, as custodian of the Vatican
archives, the author had freest access; Cretineau-Joly replied with
<i>Le Pape Clément XIV; Lettres au P. Theiner</i> (Paris, 1852).
Ravignan&rsquo;s <i>Clem. XIII. e Clem. XIV.</i> (Paris, 1854) is a weak,
half-hearted apology for Clement XIV. See also v. Reumont, <i>Ganganelli,
Papst Clemens XIV.</i> (Berlin, 1847); and Reinerding, <i>Clemens XIV.
u. d. Aufhebung der Gesellschaft Jesu</i> (Augsburg, 1854). The letters
of Clement have frequently been printed; the genuineness of
Caraccioli&rsquo;s collection (Paris, 1776; freq. translated) has been
questioned, but most of the letters are now generally accepted
as genuine; see also <i>Clementis XIV. Epp. ac Brevia</i>, ed. Theiner
(Paris, 1852). An extended bibliography is to be found in Hergenröther,
<i>Allg. Kirchengesch.</i> (1880), iii. 510 seq.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (<i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>), Greek
Father of the Church. The little we know of him is mainly
derived from his own works. He was probably born about <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
150 of heathen parents in Athens. The earliest writer after
himself who gives us any information with regard to him is
Eusebius. The only points on which his works now extant
inform us are his date and his instructors. In the <i>Stromateis</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>488</span>
while attempting to show that the Jewish Scriptures were older
than any writings of the Greeks, he invariably brings down his
dates to the death of Commodus, a circumstance which at once
suggests that he wrote in the reign of the emperor Severus, from
193 to 211 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> (see <i>Strom.</i> lib. i. cap. xxi. 140, p. 403, Potter&rsquo;s
edition). The passage in regard to his teachers is corrupt, and
the sense is therefore doubtful (<i>Strom.</i> lib. i. cap. i. 11, p. 322, P.).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;This treatise,&rdquo; he says, speaking of the <i>Stromateis</i>, &ldquo;has not
been contrived for mere display, but memoranda are treasured up
in it for my old age to be a remedy for forgetfulness,&mdash;an image, truly,
and an outline of those clear and living discourses, and those men
truly blessed and noteworthy I was privileged to hear. One of these
was in Greece, the Ionian, the other was in Magna Graecia; the one
of them was from Coele Syria, the other from Egypt; but there were
others in the East, one of whom belonged to the Assyrians, but
the other was in Palestine, originally a Jew. The last of those
whom I met was first in power. On falling in with him I found
rest, having tracked him while he lay concealed in Egypt. He
was in truth the Sicilian bee, and, plucking the flowers of the
prophetic and apostolic meadow, he produced a wonderfully pure
knowledge in the souls of the listeners.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Some have supposed that in this passage seven teachers are
named, others that there are only five, and various conjectures
have been hazarded as to what persons were meant. The only
one about whom conjecture has any basis for speculating is the
last, for Eusebius states (<i>H.E.</i> v. 11) that Clement made mention
of Pantaenus as his teacher in the <i>Hypotyposes</i>. The reference
in this passage is plainly to one whom he might well designate as
his teacher.</p>

<p>To the information which Clement here supplies subsequent
writers add little. By Eusebius and Photius he is called Titus
Flavius Clemens, and &ldquo;the Alexandrian&rdquo; is added to his name.
Epiphanius tells us that some said Clement was an Alexandrian,
others that he was an Athenian (<i>Haer.</i> xxxii. 6), and a modern
writer imagined that he reconciled this discordance by the
supposition that he was born at Athens, but lived at Alexandria.
We know nothing of his conversion except that he passed from
heathenism to Christianity. This is expressly stated by Eusebius
(<i>Praep. Evangel.</i> lib. ii. cap. 2), though it is likely that Eusebius
had no other authority than the works of Clement. These works,
however, warrant the inference. They show a singularly minute
acquaintance with the ceremonies of pagan religion, and there
are indications that Clement himself had been initiated in some
of the mysteries (<i>Protrept.</i> cap. ii. sec. 14, p. 13, P.). There is
no means of determining the date of his conversion. He attained
the position of presbyter in the church of Alexandria (Eus.
<i>H.E.</i> vi. 11, and Jerome, <i>De Vir. Ill.</i> 38), and became perhaps
the assistant, and certainly the successor of Pantaenus in the
catechetical school of that place. Among his pupils were Origen
(Eus. <i>H.E.</i> vi. 7) and Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem (Eus. <i>H.E.</i>
vi. 14.). How long he continued in Alexandria, and when and
where he died, are all matters of pure conjecture. The only
further notice of Clement that we have in history is in a letter
written in 211 by Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, to the
Antiochians, and preserved by Eusebius (<i>H.E.</i> vi. 11). The
words are as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This letter I sent through Clement
the blessed presbyter, a man virtuous and tried, whom ye know
and will come to know completely, who being here by the
providence and guidance of the Ruler of all strengthened and
increased the church of the Lord.&rdquo; A statement of Eusebius in
regard to the persecution of Severus in 202 (<i>H.E.</i> vi. 3) would
render it likely that Clement left Alexandria on that occasion.
It is conjectured that he went to his old pupil Alexander, who was
at that time bishop of Flaviada in Cappadocia, and that when his
pupil was raised to the see of Jerusalem Clement followed him
there. The letter implies that he was known to the Antiochians,
and that it was likely he would be still better known. Some
have conjectured that he returned to Alexandria, but there is not
the shadow of evidence for such conjecture. Alexander, writing
to Origen (c. 216), mentions Clement as dead (Eus. <i>H.E.</i> vi. 14, 9).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Eusebius and Jerome give us lists of the works which Clement
left behind him. Photius has also described some of them. They
are as follows:&mdash;(1) <span class="grk" title="Pros Hellênas logos o protreptikos">
&#928;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#904;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#8001; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>A Hortatory

&#908; &#928;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span>, <i>The Tutor</i>, in three books.
(3) <span class="grk" title="Stromateis">&#931;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span>, or <i>Patch-work</i>, in eight books. (4) <span class="grk" title="Tis o sozomenos plousios">
&#932;&#7984;&#962; &#8056; &#963;&#969;&#958;&#8000;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>; <i>Who is the Rich Man that is Saved?</i> (5) Eight books of
<span class="grk" title="Hypotyposeis">&#910;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#965;&#960;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>, <i>Adumbrations or Outlines.</i> (6) <i>On the Passover.</i> (7) <i>Discourses
on Fasting.</i> (8) <i>On Slander.</i> (9) <i>Exhortation to Patience, or
to the Newly Baptized.</i> (10) The <span class="grk" title="Kanon ekklêsiastikos">&#922;&#945;&#957;&#8060;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, the <i>Rule of
the Church, or to those who Judaize</i>, a work dedicated to Alexander,
bishop of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Of these, the first four have come down to us complete, or nearly
complete. The first three form together a progressive introduction
to Christianity corresponding to the stages through which the
<span class="grk" title="mystês">&#956;&#8016;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> passed at Eleusis&mdash;purification, initiation, revelation. The
<i>Hortatory Address to the Greeks</i> is an appeal to them to give up the
worship of their gods, and to devote themselves to the worship of the
one living and true God. Clement exhibits the absurdity and immorality
of the stories told with regard to the pagan deities, the cruelties
perpetrated in their worship, and the utter uselessness of bowing
down before images made by hands. He at the same time shows
the Greeks that their own greatest philosophers and poets recognized
the unity of the divine Being, and had caught glimpses of the true
nature of God, but that fuller light had been thrown on this subject
by the Hebrew prophets. He replies to the objection that it was
not right to abandon the customs of their forefathers, and points
them to Christ as their only safe guide to God.</p>

<p>The <i>Paedagogue</i> is divided into three books. In the first Clement
discusses the necessity for and the true nature of the Paedagogus,
and shows how Christ as the Logos acted as Paedagogus, and still
acts. In the second and third books Clement enters into particulars,
and explains how the Christian following the Logos or Reason ought
to behave in the various circumstances of life&mdash;in eating, drinking,
furnishing a house, in dress, in the relations of social life, in the care
of the body, and similar concerns, and concludes with a general
description of the life of a Christian. Appended to the <i>Paedagogue</i>
are two hymns, which are, in all probability, the production of
Clement, though some have conjectured that they were portions
of the church service of that time. <span class="grk" title="stromateis">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> were bags in which
bedclothes (<span class="grk" title="stromata">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>) were kept. The phrase was used as a book-title
by Origen and others, and is equivalent to our &ldquo;miscellanies.&rdquo;
It is difficult to give a brief account of the varied contents of the
book. Sometimes Clement discusses chronology, sometimes philosophy,
sometimes poetry, entering into the most minute critical
and chronological details; but one object runs through all, and
this is to show what the true Christian Gnostic is, and what is his
relation to philosophy. The work was in eight books. The first
seven are complete. The eighth now extant is really an incomplete
treatise on logic. Some critics have rejected this book as spurious,
since its matter is so different from that of the rest. Others, however,
have held to its genuineness, because in a Patch-work or Book of
Miscellanies the difference of subject is no sound objection, and
because Photius seems to have regarded our present eighth book as
genuine (Phot. cod. iii. p. 89b, Bekker).</p>

<p>The treatise <i>Who is the Rich Man that is Saved?</i> is an admirable
exposition of the narrative contained in St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel x. 17-31.
Here Clement argues that wealth, if rightly used, is not unchristian.</p>

<p>The <i>Hypotyposes</i><a name="FnAnchor_1q" id="FnAnchor_1q" href="#Footnote_1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in eight books, have not come down to us.
Cassiodorus translated them into Latin, freely altering to suit his
own ideas of orthodoxy. Both Eusebius and Photius describe the
work. It was a short commentary on all the books of Scripture,
including some of the apocryphal works, such as the Epistle of
Barnabas and the Revelation of Peter. Photius speaks in strong
language of the impiety of some opinions in the book (<i>Bibl.</i> cod. 109,
p. 89 a Bekker), but his statements are such as to prove conclusively
that he must have had a corrupt copy, or read very carelessly, or
grossly misunderstood Clement. Notes in Latin on the first epistle
of Peter, the epistle of Jude, and the first two of John have come
down to us; but whether they are the translation of Cassiodorus,
or indeed a translation of Clement&rsquo;s work at all, is a matter of
dispute.</p>

<p>The treatise on the Passover was occasioned by a work of Melito
on the same subject. Two fragments of this treatise were given by
Petavius, and are contained in the modern editions.</p>

<p>We know nothing of the work called <i>The Ecclesiastical Canon</i>
from any external testimony. Clement himself often mentions the
<span class="grk" title="ekklêsiastikos kanon">&#7952;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#957;&#974;&#957;</span>, and defines it as the agreement and harmony
of the law and the prophets with the covenant delivered at the
appearance of Christ (<i>Strom.</i> vi. cap. xv. 125, p. 803, P.). No doubt
this was the subject of the treatise. Jerome and Photius call the
work <i>Ecclesiastical Canons</i>, but this seems to be a mistake.</p>

<p>Of the other treatises mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome nothing
is known. A fragment of Clement, quoted by Antonius Melissa, is
most probably taken from the treatise on slander.</p>

<p>Besides the treatises mentioned by Eusebius, fragments of treatises
on Providence and the Soul have been preserved. Mention is also
made of a work by Clement on the Prophet Amos, and another on
Definitions.</p>

<p>In addition to these Clement often speaks of his intention to
write on certain subjects, but it may well be doubted whether in
most cases, if not all, he intended to devote separate treatises to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>489</span>
them. Some have found an allusion to the treatise on the Soul
already mentioned. The other subjects are Marriage (<span class="grk" title="gamikos logos">&#947;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>),
Continence, the Duties of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons and Widows,
Prophecy, the Soul, the Transmigration of the Soul and the Devil,
Angels, the Origin of the World, First Principles and the Divinity of
the Logos, Allegorical Interpretations of Statements made with
regard to God&rsquo;s anger and similar affections, the Unity of the Church,
and the Resurrection.</p>

<p>Two works are incorporated in the editions of Clement which
are not mentioned by himself or any ancient writer. They are
<span class="grk" title="Ek tôn Theodoton kai tês anatolikês kaloumenês didaskalias kata tous Oualentinou chronous epitomai">

first, if it is the work of Clement, must be a book merely of
excerpts, for it contains many opinions which Clement opposed.
Mention is made of Pantaenus in the second, and some have thought
it more worthy of him than the first. Others have regarded it as
a work similar to the first, and derived from Theodorus.</p>
</div>

<p>Clement occupies a profoundly interesting position in the
history of Christianity. He is the first to bring all the culture
of the Greeks and all the speculations of the Christian heretics
to bear on the exposition of Christian truth. He does not attain
to a systematic exhibition of Christian doctrine, but he paves the
way for it, and lays the first stones of the foundation. In some
respects Justin anticipated him. He also was well acquainted
with Greek philosophy, and took a genial view of it; but he was
not nearly so widely read as Clement. The list of Greek authors
whom Clement has quoted occupies upwards of fourteen of the
quarto pages in Fabricius&rsquo;s <i>Bibliotheca Graeca</i>. He is at home
alike in the epic and the lyric, the tragic and the comic poets, and
his knowledge of the prose writers is very extensive. Some,
however, of the classic poets he appears to have known only
from anthologies; hence he was misled into quoting as from
Euripides and others verses which were written by Jewish
forgers. He made a special study of the philosophers. Equally
minute is his knowledge of the systems of the Christian heretics.
And in all cases it is plain that he not merely read but thought
deeply on the questions which the civilization of the Greeks and
the various writings of poets, philosophers and heretics raised.
But it was in the Scriptures that he found his greatest delight.
He believed them to contain the revelation of God&rsquo;s wisdom to
men. He quotes all the books of the Old Testament except
Ruth and the Song of Solomon, and amongst the sacred writings
of the Old Testament he evidently included the book of Tobit,
the Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus. He is equally full
in his quotations from the New Testament, for he quotes from all
the books except the epistle to Philemon, the second epistle
of St Peter, and the epistle of St James, and he quotes from
<i>The Shepherd of Hermas</i>, and the epistles of Clemens Romanus
and of Barnabas, as inspired. He appeals also to many of the
lost gospels, such as those of the Hebrews, of the Egyptians and
of Matthias.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this adequate knowledge of Scripture, the
modern theologian is disappointed to find very little of what he
deems characteristically Christian. In fact Clement regarded
Christianity as a philosophy. The ancient philosophers sought
through their philosophy to attain to a nobler and holier life,
and this also was the aim of Christianity. The difference between
the two, in Clement&rsquo;s judgment, was that the Greek philosophers
had only glimpses of the truth, that they attained only to
fragments of the truth, while Christianity revealed in Christ
the absolute and perfect truth. All the stages of the world&rsquo;s
history were therefore preparations leading up to this full
revelation, and God&rsquo;s care was not confined to the Hebrews
alone. The worship of the heavenly bodies, for instance, was
given to man at an early stage that he might rise from a
contemplation of these sublime objects to the worship of the Creator.
Greek philosophy in particular was the preparation of the Greeks
for Christ. It was the schoolmaster or paedagogue to lead them
to Christ. Plato was Moses atticizing. Clement varies in his
statement how Plato got his wisdom or his fragments of the
Reason. Sometimes he thinks that they came direct from God,
like all good things, but he is also fond of maintaining that
many of Plato&rsquo;s best thoughts were borrowed from the Hebrew
prophets; and he makes the same statement in regard to the
wisdom of the other philosophers. But however this may be,
Christ was the end to which all that was true in philosophies
pointed. Christ himself was the Logos, the Reason. God the
Father was ineffable. The Son alone can manifest Him fully.
He is the Reason that pervades the universe, that brings out all
goodness, that guides all good men. It was through possessing
somewhat of this Reason that the philosophers attained to any
truth and goodness; but in Christians he dwells more fully and
guides them through all the perplexities of life. Photius, probably
on a careless reading of Clement, argued that he could not
have believed in a real incarnation. But the words of Clement
are quite precise and their meaning indisputable. The real
difficulty attaches not to the Second Person, but to the First.
The Father in Clement&rsquo;s mind becomes the Absolute of the
philosophers, that is to say, not the Father at all, but the Monad,
a mere point devoid of all attributes. He believed in a personal
Son of God who was the Reason and Wisdom of God; and he
believed that this Son of God really became incarnate though he
speaks of him almost invariably as the Word, and attaches
little value to his human nature. The object of his incarnation
and death was to free man from his sins, to lead him into the path
of wisdom, and thus in the end elevate him to the position of a
god. But man&rsquo;s salvation was to be gradual. It began with
faith, passed from that to love, and ended in full and complete
knowledge. There could be no faith without knowledge. But
the knowledge is imperfect, and the Christian was to do many
things in simple obedience without knowing the reason. But
he has to move upwards continually until he at length does
nothing that is evil, and he knows fully the reason and object
of what he does. He thus becomes the true Gnostic, but he can
become the true Gnostic only by contemplation and by the
practice of what is right. He has to free himself from the power
of passion. He has to give up all thoughts of pleasure. He must
prefer goodness in the midst of torture to evil with unlimited
pleasure. He has to resist the temptations of the body, keeping
it under strict control, and with the eye of the soul undimmed by
corporeal wants and impulses, contemplate God the supreme
good, and live a life according to reason. In other words, he
must strive after likeness to God as he reveals himself in his
Reason or in Christ. Clement thus looks entirely at the enlightened
moral elevation to which Christianity raises man. He
believed that Christ instructed men before he came into the
world, and he therefore viewed heathenism with kindly eye.
He was also favourable to the pursuit of all kinds of knowledge.
All enlightenment tended to lead up to the truths of Christianity,
and hence knowledge of every kind not evil was its handmaid.
Clement had at the same time a strong belief in evolution or
development. The world went through various stages in preparation
for Christianity. The man goes through various stages
before he can reach Christian perfection. And Clement conceived
that this development took place not merely in this life, but in
the future through successive grades. The Jew and the heathen
had the gospel preached to them in the world below by Christ
and his apostles, and Christians will have to pass through processes
of purification and trial after death before they reach
knowledge and perfect bliss.</p>

<p>The beliefs of Clement have caused considerable difference
of opinion among modern scholars. He sought the truth from
whatever quarter he could get it, believing that all that is good
comes from God, wherever it be found. He belongs therefore
to no school of philosophers. He calls himself an Eclectic.
He was in the main a Neoplatonist, drawing from that school
his doctrines of the Monad and his strong tendency towards
mysticism. For his moral doctrine he borrowed freely from
Stoicism. Aristotelian features may be found but are quite
subordinate. But Clement always regards the articles of the
Christian creed as the axioms of a new philosophy. Daehne
had tried to show that he was Neoplatonic, and Reinkens has
maintained that he was essentially Aristotelian. His mode of
viewing Christianity does not fit into any classification. It
is the result of the period in which he lived, of his wide culture
and the simplicity and noble purity of his character.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that his books well deserve study; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>490</span>
the study is not smoothed by simplicity of style. Clement
professed to despise rhetoric, but was himself a rhetorician, and
his style is turgid, involved and difficult. He is singularly
simple in his character. In discussing marriage he refuses to
use any but the plainest language. A euphemism is with him
a falsehood. But he is temperate in his opinions; and the
practical advices in the second and third books of the <i>Paedagogue</i>
are remarkably sound and moderate. He is not always very
critical, and he is passionately fond of allegorical interpretations,
but these were the faults of his age.</p>

<p>All early writers speak of Clement in the highest terms of
laudation, and he certainly ought to have been a saint in any
Church that reveres saints. But Clement is not a saint in the
Roman Church. He was a saint up till the time of Benedict
XIV., who read Photius on Clement, believed him, and struck
the Alexandrian&rsquo;s name out of the calendar. But many Roman
Catholic writers, though they yield a practical obedience to the
papal decision, have adduced good reason why it should be
reversed (Cognat, p. 451).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLÉMENT, FRANÇOIS<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (1714-1793), French historian, was
born at Bèze, near Dijon, and was educated at the Jesuit College
at Dijon. At the age of seventeen he entered the society of the
Benedictines of Saint Maur, and worked with such intense
application that at the age of twenty-five he was obliged to take
a protracted rest. He now resided in Paris, where he wrote the
11th and 12th vols. of the <i>Histoire littéraire de la France</i>, and
edited (with Dom Brial) the 12th and 13th vols. of the <i>Recueil
des historiens des Gauls et de la France</i>. The king appointed
him on the committee which was engaged in publishing charters,
diplomas and other documents connected with French history (see
Xavier Charmes, <i>Le Comité des travaux historiques et scientifiques</i>,
vol. i., 1886, passim); and the Academy of Inscriptions chose
him as a member (1785). Dom Clément also revised the <i>Art de
vérifier les dates</i>, edited in 1750 by Dom Clémencet. Three
volumes with the Indexes appeared from 1783 to 1792. He
was engaged in preparing another volume including the period
before the Christian era, when he died suddenly of apoplexy, at
the age of sixty-nine. The work was afterwards brought down
from 1770 to 1827 by Julien de Courcelles and Fortia d&rsquo;Urban.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLÉMENT, JACQUES<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> (1567-1589), murderer of the French
king Henry III., was born at Sorbon in the Ardennes, and
became a Dominican friar. Civil war was raging in France,
and Clément became an ardent partisan of the League; his
mind appears to have become unhinged by religious fanaticism,
and he talked of exterminating the heretics, and formed a plan
to kill Henry III. His project was encouraged by some of the
heads of the League; he was assured of temporal rewards if he
succeeded, and of eternal bliss if he failed. Having obtained
letters for the king, he left Paris on the 31st of July 1589, and
reached St Cloud, the headquarters of Henry, who was besieging
Paris. On the following day he was admitted to the royal
presence, and presenting his letters he told the king that he had
an important and confidential message to deliver. The attendants
then withdrew, and while Henry was reading the letters
Clément mortally wounded him with a dagger which had been
concealed beneath his cloak. The assassin was at once killed
by the attendants who rushed in, and Henry died early on the
following day. Clément&rsquo;s body was afterwards quartered and
burned. This deed, however, was viewed with far different
feelings in Paris and by the partisans of the League, the murderer
being regarded as a martyr and extolled by Pope Sixtus V.,
while even his canonization was discussed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEMENTI, MUZIO<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> (c. 1751-1832), Italian pianist and composer,
was born at Rome between 1750 and 1752. His father,
a jeweller, encouraged his son&rsquo;s early musical talent. Buroni
and Cordicelli were his first masters, and at the age of nine
Clementi&rsquo;s theoretical and practical studies had advanced to
such a degree that he was able to win the position of organist
at a church. He continued his studies under Santarelli and
Carpani, and at the age of fourteen wrote a mass which was
performed in public. About 1766 Beckford, the author of
<i>Vathek</i>, persuaded Clementi to follow him to England, where
the young composer lived in retirement at one of the country
seats of his protector in Dorsetshire until 1770. In that year
he first appeared in London, where his success both as composer
and pianist was rapid and brilliant. In 1777 he was for some
time employed as conductor of the Italian opera, but he soon
afterwards left London for Paris. Here also his concerts were
crowded by enthusiastic audiences, and the same success accompanied
Clementi on a tour about the year 1780 to southern
Germany and Austria. At Vienna, which he visited between
1781 and 1782, he was received with high honour by the emperor
Joseph II., in whose presence he met Mozart, and fought a kind
of musical duel with him. His technical skill proved to be
equal if not superior to that of his rival, who on the other hand
infinitely surpassed him by the passionate beauty of his interpretation.
It is worth noting that one of the finest of Clementi&rsquo;s
sonatas, that in B flat, shows an exactly identical opening theme
with Mozart&rsquo;s overture to the <i>Flauto Magico</i>.</p>

<p>In May 1782 Clementi returned to London, where for the next
twelve years he continued his lucrative occupations of fashionable
teacher and performer at the concerts of the aristocracy. He
took shares in the pianoforte business of a firm which went
bankrupt in 1800. He then established a pianoforte and music
business of his own, under the name of Clementi &amp; Co. Other
members were added to the firm, including Collard and Davis,
and the firm was ultimately taken over by Messrs Collard
alone. Amongst his pupils on the pianoforte during this period
may be mentioned John Field, the composer of the celebrated
<i>Nocturnes</i>. In his company Clementi paid, in 1804, a visit to
Paris, Vienna, St Petersburg, Berlin and other cities. While
he was in Berlin, Meyerbeer became one of his pupils. He also
revisited his own country after an absence of more than thirty
years. In 1810 Clementi returned to London, but refused to
play again in public, devoting the remainder of his life to composition.
Several symphonies belong to this time, and were
played with much success at contemporary concerts, but none
of them seem to have been published. His intellectual and
musical faculties remained unimpaired until his death, on the
9th of March 1832, at Evesham, Worcester.</p>

<p>Of Clementi&rsquo;s playing in his youth, Moscheles wrote that it
was &ldquo;marked by a most beautiful <i>legato</i>, a supple touch in lively
passages, and a most unfailing <i>technique</i>.&rdquo; Mozart may be said
to have closed the old and Clementi to have founded the newer
school of <i>technique</i> on the piano. Amongst Clementi&rsquo;s compositions
the most remarkable are sixty sonatas for pianoforte, and
the great collection of <i>Études</i> called <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLEMENTINE LITERATURE<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span>, the name generally given to the
writings which at one time or another were fathered upon Pope
Clement I. (<i>q.v.</i>), commonly called Clemens Romanus, who was
early regarded as a disciple of St Peter. Thus they are for the
most part a species of the larger pseudo-Petrine genus. Chief
among them are: (1) The so-called Second Epistle; (2) two
Epistles on Virginity; (3) the <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>; (4)
the <i>Apostolical Constitutions</i> (<i>q.v.</i>); and (5) five epistles forming
part of the Forged Decretals (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Decretals</a></span>). The present
article deals mainly with the third group, to which the title
&ldquo;Clementine literature&rdquo; is usually confined, owing to the stress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>491</span>
laid upon it in the famous Tübingen reconstruction of primitive
Christianity, in which it played a leading part; but later criticism
has lowered its importance as its true date and historical
relations have been progressively ascertained. (1) and (2)
became &ldquo;Clementine&rdquo; only by chance, but (3) was so originally
by literary device or fiction, the cause at work also in (4) and (5).
But while in all cases the suggestion of Clement&rsquo;s authorship
came ultimately from his prestige as writer of the genuine
Epistle of Clement (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Clement i.</a></span>), both (3) and (4) were due to
this idea as operative on Syrian soil; (5) is a secondary formation
based on (3) as known to the West.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The &ldquo;Second Epistle of Clement.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;This is really the
earliest extant Christian homily (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Apostolic Fathers</a></span>). Its
theme is the duty of Christian repentance, with a view to
obedience to Christ&rsquo;s precepts as the true confession and homage
which He requires. Its special charge is &ldquo;Preserve the flesh pure
and the seal (<i>i.e.</i> baptism) unstained&rdquo; (viii. 6). But the peculiar
way in which it enforces its morals in terms of the Platonic
contrast between the spiritual and sensuous worlds, as archetype
and temporal manifestation, suggests a special local type of
theology which must be taken into account in fixing its <i>provenance</i>.
This theology, the fact that the preacher seems to quote the
<i>Gospel according to the Egyptians</i> (in ch. xii. and possibly elsewhere)
as if familiar to his hearers, and indeed its literary
affinities generally, all point to Alexandria as the original home of
the homily, at a date about 120-140 (see <i>Zeit. f. N. T. Wissenschaft</i>,
vii. 123 ff). Neither Corinth (as Lightfoot) nor Rome (as Harnack,
who assigns it to Bishop Soter, c. 166-174) satisfies all the internal
conditions, while the Eastern nature of the external evidence and
the homily&rsquo;s quasi-canonical status in the Codex-Alexandrinus
strongly favour an Alexandrine origin.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Two Epistles to Virgins</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to Christian celibates of
both sexes. These are known in their entirety only in Syriac,
and were first published by Wetstein (1752), who held them
genuine. This view is now generally discredited, even by Roman
Catholics like Funk, their best recent editor (<i>Patres Apost.</i>, vol.
ii.). External evidence begins with Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> xxx. 15)
and Jerome (<i>Ad Jovin.</i> i. 12);  and the silence of Eusebius tells
heavily against their existence before the 4th century, at any
rate as writings of Clement. The Monophysite Timothy of
Alexandria (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 457) cites one of them as Clement&rsquo;s, while
Antiochus of St Saba (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 620) makes copious but unacknowledged
extracts from both in the original Greek. There is no
trace of their use in the West. Thus their Syrian origin is
manifest, the more so that in the Syriac MS. they are appended to
the New Testament, like the better-known epistles of Clement in
the Codex Alexandrinus. Indeed, judging from another Syriac
MS. of earlier date, which includes the latter writings in its
canon, it seems that the Epistles on Virginity gradually replaced
the earlier pair in certain Syrian churches&mdash;even should Lightfoot
be right in doubting if this had really occurred by Epiphanius&rsquo;s
day (<i>S. Clement of Rome</i>, i. 412).</p>

<p>Probably these epistles did not originally bear Clement&rsquo;s name
at all, but formed a single epistle addressed to ascetics among an
actual circle of churches. In that case they, or rather it, may
date from the 3rd century in spite of Eusebius&rsquo;s silence, and
are not pseudo-Clementine in any real sense. It matters little
whether or not the false ascription was made before the division
into two implied already by Epiphanius (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 375). Special
occasion for such a hortatory letter may be discerned in its
polemic against intimate relations between ascetics of opposite
sex, implied to exist among its readers, in contrast to usage in
the writer&rsquo;s own locality. Now we know that spiritual unions,
prompted originally by highstrung Christian idealism as to a
religious fellowship transcending the law of nature in relation to
sex, did exist between persons living under vows of celibacy
during the 3rd century in particular, and not least in Syria (cf.
the case of Paul of Samosata, c. 265, and the Synod of Ancyra
in Galatia, c. 314). It is natural, then, to see in the original
epistle a protest against the dangers of such spiritual boldness
(cf. &ldquo;Subintroductae&rdquo; in Herzog-Hauck&rsquo;s <i>Realencyklopädie</i>),
prior perhaps to the famous case at Antioch just noted.
Possibly it is the feeling of south Syria or Palestine that here
expresses itself in remonstrance against usages prevalent in north
Syria. Such a view finds support also in the New Testament
canon implied in these epistles.</p>

<p>(3)[a] <i>The Epistle of Clement to James</i> (the Lord&rsquo;s brother).
This was originally part of (3)[b], in connexion with which its
origin and date are discussed. But as known to the West through
Rufinus&rsquo;s Latin version, it was quoted as genuine by the synod of
Vaison (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 442) and throughout the middle ages. It became
&ldquo;the starting point of the most momentous and gigantic of
medieval forgeries, the Isidorian Decretals,&rdquo; &ldquo;where it stands at
the head of the pontifical letters, extended to more than twice its
original length.&rdquo; This extension perhaps occurred during the 5th
century. At any rate the letter in this form, along with a
&ldquo;second epistle to James&rdquo; (on the Eucharist, church furniture,
&amp;c.), dating from the early 6th century, had separate currency
long before the 9th century, when they were incorporated in the
<i>Decretals</i> by the forger who raised the Clementine epistles to five
(see Lightfoot, <i>Clement</i>, i. 414 ff.).</p>

<p>(3)[b] <i>The &ldquo;Homilies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recognitions</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The two
chief extant Clementine writings, differing considerably in some
respects in doctrine, are both evidently the outcome of a peculiar
speculative type of Judaistic Christianity, for which the most
characteristic name of Christ was &lsquo;the true Prophet.&rsquo; The framework
of both is a narrative purporting to be written by Clement
(of Rome) to St James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother, describing at the
beginning his own conversion and the circumstances of his first
acquaintance with St Peter, and then a long succession of
incidents accompanying St Peter&rsquo;s discourses and disputations,
leading up to a romantic recognition of Clement&rsquo;s father, mother
and two brothers, from whom he had been separated since childhood.
The problems discussed under this fictitious guise are
with rare exceptions fundamental problems for every age; and,
whatever may be thought of the positions maintained, the
discussions are hardly ever feeble or trivial. Regarded simply as
mirroring the past, few, if any, remains of Christian antiquity
present us with so vivid a picture of the working of men&rsquo;s minds
under the influence of the new leaven which had entered into the
world&rdquo; (Hort, <i>Clem. Recog.</i>, p. xiv.).</p>

<p>The indispensable preliminary to a really historic view of these
writings is some solution of the problem of their mutual relations.
The older criticism assumed a dependence of one upon the other,
and assigned one or both to the latter part of the 2nd century.
Recent criticism, however, builds on the principle, which emerges
alike from the external and internal evidence (see Salmon in
the <i>Dict. of Christian Biography</i>), that both used a common
basis. Our main task, then, is to define the nature, origin and
date of the parent document, and if possible its own literary
antecedents. Towards the solution of this problem two contributions
of prime importance have recently been made. The
earlier of these is by F.J.A. Hort, and was delivered in the form
of lectures as far back as 1884, though issued posthumously only
in 1901; the other is the elaborate monograph of Dr Hans
Waitz (1904).</p>

<p><i>Criticism.</i>&mdash;(i.) <i>External Evidence as to the Clementine Romance.</i>
The evidence of ancient writers really begins, not with Origen,<a name="FnAnchor_1r" id="FnAnchor_1r" href="#Footnote_1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
but with Eusebius of Caesarea, who in his <i>Eccl. Hist.</i> iii. 38,
writes as follows: &ldquo;Certain men have quite lately brought
forward as written by him (Clement) other verbose and lengthy
writings, containing dialogues of Peter, forsooth, and Apion,
whereof not the slightest mention is to be found among the
ancients, for they do not even preserve in purity the stamp of
the Apostolic orthodoxy.&rdquo; Apion, the Alexandrine grammarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>492</span>
and foe of Judaism, whose criticism was answered by Josephus,
appears in this character both in <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>,
though mainly in the former (iv. 6-vii. 5). Thus Eusebius
implies (1) a spurious Clementine work containing matter found
also in our <i>Homilies</i> at any rate; and (2) its quite recent origin.
Next we note that an extract in the <i>Philocalia</i> is introduced
as follows: &ldquo;Yea, and Clement the Roman, a disciple of Peter
the Apostle, after using words in harmony with these on the
present problem, in conversation with his father at Laodicea
in the <i>Circuits</i>, speaks a very necessary word for the end of
arguments touching this matter, viz. those things which seem
to have proceeded from <i>genesis</i> (= astrological destiny), in the
fourteenth book.&rdquo; The extract answers to <i>Recognitions</i>, x. 10-13,
but it is absent from our <i>Homilies</i>. Here we observe that (1) the
extract agrees this time with <i>Recognitions</i>, not with <i>Homilies</i>;
(2) its framework is that of the Clementine romance found in
both; (3) the tenth and last book of <i>Recognitions</i> is here parallel
to book xiv. of a work called <i>Circuits</i> (<i>Periodoi</i>).</p>

<p>This last point leads on naturally to the witness of Epiphanius
(c. 375), who, speaking of Ebionites or Judaizing Christians of
various sorts, and particularly the Essene type, says (<i>Haer.</i>
xxx. 15) that &ldquo;they use certain other books likewise, to wit,
the so-called <i>Circuits</i> of Peter, which were written by the hand
of Clement, falsifying their contents, though leaving a few
genuine things.&rdquo; Here Ephiphanius simply assumes that the
Ebionite <i>Circuits of Peter</i> was based on a genuine work of the
same scope, and goes on to say that the spurious elements are
proved such by contrast with the tenor of Clement&rsquo;s &ldquo;encyclic
epistles&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> those to virgins, (2) above); for these enjoin
virginity (celibacy), and praise Elijah, David, Samson, and all
the prophets, whereas the Ebionite <i>Circuits</i> favour marriage
(even in Apostles) and depreciate the prophets between Moses
and Christ, &ldquo;the true Prophet.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the <i>Circuits</i>, then, they
adapted the whole to their own views, representing Peter falsely
in many ways, as that he was daily baptized for the sake of
purification, as these also do; and they say that he likewise
abstained from animal food and meat, as they themselves also
do.&rdquo; Now all the points here noted in the <i>Circuits</i> can be traced
in our <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>, though toned down in different
degrees.</p>

<p>The witness of the Arianizing <i>Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum</i>
(c. 400) is in general similar. Its usual form of citation is &ldquo;Peter
in Clement&rdquo; (<i>apud Clementem</i>). This points to &ldquo;Clement&rdquo;
as a brief title for the Clementine <i>Periodoi</i>, a title actually found
in a Syriac MS. of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 411 which contains large parts of <i>Recognitions</i>
and <i>Homilies</i>, and twice used by Rufinus, <i>e.g.</i> when he
proposes to inscribe his version of the <i>Recognitions</i> &ldquo;Rufinus
<i>Clemens</i>.&rdquo; Rufinus in his preface to this work&mdash;in which for
the first time we meet the title <i>Recognition(s)</i>&mdash;observes that
there are two editions to which the name applies, two collections
of books differing in some points but in many respects containing
the same narrative. This he remarks in explanation of the order
of his version in some places, which he feels may strike his friend
Gaudentius as unusual, the inference being that the other
edition was the better-known one, although it lacked &ldquo;the
transformation of Simon&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> of Clement&rsquo;s father into Simon&rsquo;s
likeness), which is common to the close both of our <i>Recognitions</i>
and <i>Homilies</i>, and so probably belonged to the <i>Circuits</i>. We
may assume, too (<i>e.g.</i> on the basis of our Syriac MS.), that the
Greek edition of the <i>Recognition(s)</i> actually used by Rufinus
was much nearer the text of the <i>Periodoi</i> of which we have found
traces than we should imagine from its Latin form.</p>

<p>So far we have no sure trace of our <i>Homilies</i> at all, apart from
the Syriac version. Even four centuries later, Photius, in referring
to a collection of books called both <i>Acts of Peter</i> and the
<i>Recognition of Clement</i>, does not make clear whether he means
<i>Homilies</i> or <i>Recognitions</i> or either. &ldquo;In all the copies which
we have seen (and they are not a few) after those different
epistles (viz. &lsquo;Peter to James&rsquo; and &lsquo;Clement to James,&rsquo; prefixed,
the one in some MSS. the other in others) and titles, we found
without variation the same treatise, beginning, I, Clement, &amp;c.&rdquo;
But it is not clear that he had read more than the opening of
these MSS. The fact that different epistles are prefixed to the
same work leads him to conjecture &ldquo;that there were two editions
made of the <i>Acts of Peter</i> (his usual title for the collection), but
in course of time the one perished and that of Clement prevailed.&rdquo;
This is interesting as anticipating a result of modern criticism,
as will appear below. The earliest probable reference to our
<i>Homilies</i> occurs in a work of doubtful date, the pseudo-Athanasian
<i>Synopsis</i>, which mentions &ldquo;Clementines, whence
came by selection and rewriting the true and inspired form.&rdquo;
Here too we have the first sure trace of an expurgated recension,
made with the idea of recovering the genuine form assumed, as
earlier by Epiphanius, to lie behind an unorthodox recension
of Clement&rsquo;s narrative. As, moreover, the extant <i>Epitome</i> is
based on our <i>Homilies</i>, it is natural to suppose it was also the
basis of earlier orthodox recensions, one or more of which
may be used in certain Florilegia of the 7th century and later.
Nowhere do we find the title <i>Homilies</i> given to any form of
the Clementine collection in antiquity.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>The Genesis of the Clementine Literature.</i> It has been needful
to cite so much of the evidence proving that our <i>Homilies</i> and
<i>Recognitions</i> are both recensions of a common basis, at first known
as the <i>Circuits of Peter</i> and later by titles connecting it rather
with Clement, its ostensible author, because it affords data also
for the historical problems touching (a) the contents and origin
of the primary Clementine work, and (b) the conditions under
which our extant recensions of it arose.</p>

<p>(a) <i>The Circuits of Peter</i>, as defined on the one hand by the
epistle of Clement to James originally prefixed to it and by
patristic evidence, and on the other by the common element in
our <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>, may be conceived as follows.
It contained accounts of Peter&rsquo;s teachings and discussions at
various points on a route beginning at Caesarea, and extending
northwards along the coast-lands of Syria as far as Antioch.
During this tour he meets with persons of typically erroneous
views, which it was presumably the aim of the work to refute
in the interests of true Christianity, conceived as the final form
of divine revelation&mdash;a revelation given through true prophecy
embodied in a succession of persons, the chief of whom were
Moses and the prophet whom Moses foretold, Jesus the Christ.
The prime exponent of the spurious religion is Simon Magus.
A second protagonist of error, this time of Gentile philosophic
criticism directed against fundamental Judaism, is Apion, the
notorious anti-Jewish Alexandrine grammarian of Peter&rsquo;s day;
while the rôle of upholder of astrological fatalism (<i>Genesis</i>) is
played by Faustus, father of Clement, with whom Peter and
Clement debate at Laodicea. Finally, all this is already embedded
in a setting determined by the romance of Clement and his lost
relatives, &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; of whom forms the <i>dénouement</i> of
the story.</p>

<p>There is no reason to doubt that such, roughly speaking, were
the contents of the Clementine work to which Eusebius alludes
slightingly, in connexion with that section of it which had to his
eye least verisimilitude, viz. the dialogues between Peter and
Apion. Now Eusebius believed the work to have been of quite
recent and suspicious origin. This points to a date about the
last quarter of the 3rd century; and the prevailing doctrinal
tone of the contents, as known to us, leads to the same result.
The standpoint is that of the peculiar Judaizing or Ebonite
Christianity due to persistence among Christians of the tendencies
known among pre-Christian Jews as Essene. The Essenes,
while clinging to what they held to be original Mosaism, yet
conceived and practised their ancestral faith in ways which
showed distinct traces of syncretism, or the operation of influences
foreign to Judaism proper. They thus occupied an ambiguous
position on the borders of Judaism. Similarly Christian Essenism
was syncretist in spirit, as we see from its best-known
representatives, the Elchasaites, of whom we first hear about
220, when a certain Alcibiades of Apamea in Syria (some 60 m.
south of Antioch) brought to Rome the <i>Book of Helxai</i>&mdash;the
manifesto of their distinctive message (Hippol., <i>Philos.</i> ix. 13)&mdash;and
again some twenty years later, when Origen refers to one of
their leaders as having lately arrived at Caesarea (Euseb. vi. 38).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>493</span>
The first half of the 3rd century was marked, especially in Syria,
by a strong tendency to syncretism, which may well have
stirred certain Christian Essenes to fresh propaganda. Other
writings than the <i>Book of Helxai</i>, representing also other species
of the same genus, would take shape. Such may have been some
of the pseudo-apostolic <i>Acts</i> to which Epiphanius alludes as in
use among the Ebionites of his own day: and such was probably
the nucleus of our Clementine writings, the <i>Periodoi</i> of Peter.</p>

<p>Harnack (<i>Chronologie</i>, ii. 522 f.), indeed, while admitting
that much (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Homilies</i>, viii. 5-7) points the other way,
prefers the view that even the <i>Circuits</i> were of Catholic origin
(Chapman, as above, says Arian, soon after 325), regarding
the syncretistic Jewish-Christian features in it as due either to
its earlier basis or to an instinct to preserve continuity of manner
(<i>e.g.</i> absence of explicit reference to Paul). Hort, on the contrary,
assumes as author &ldquo;an ingenious Helxaite ... perhaps
stimulated by the example of the many Encratite <i>Periodoi</i>&rdquo;
(p. 131), and writing about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200.</p>

<p>Only it must not be thought of as properly Elchasaite, since
it knew no baptism distinct from the ordinary Christian one.
It seems rather to represent a later and modified Essene Christianity,
already half-Catholic, such as would suit a date after
250, in keeping with Eusebius&rsquo;s evidence. Confirmation of such
a date is afforded by the silence of the Syrian <i>Didascalia</i>, itself
perhaps dating from about 250, as to any visit of Simon Magus
to Caesarea, in contrast to the reference in its later form, the
<i>Apostolical Constitutions</i> (c. 350-400), which is plainly coloured
(vi. 9) by the Clementine story. On the other hand, the <i>Didascalia</i>
seems to have been evoked partly by Judaizing propaganda
in north Syria. If, then, it helps to date the <i>Periodoi</i> as after
250, it may also suggest as place of origin one of the large cities
lying south of Antioch, say Laodicea (itself on the coast about
30 m. from Apamea), where the Clementine story reaches its
climax. The intimacy of local knowledge touching this region
implied in the narrative common to <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>
is notable, and tells against an origin for the <i>Periodoi</i> outside
Syria (<i>e.g.</i> in Rome, as Waitz and Harnack hold, but Lightfoot
disproves, <i>Clem.</i> i. 55 f., 64,100, cf. Hort, p. 131). Further,
though the curtain even in it fell on Peter at Antioch itself (our
one complete MS. of the <i>Homilies</i> is proved by the <i>Epitome</i>,
based on the <i>Homilies</i>, to be here abridged), the interest of the
story culminates at Laodicea.</p>

<p>If we assume, then, that the common source of our extant
Clementines arose in Syria, perhaps c. 265,<a name="FnAnchor_2r" id="FnAnchor_2r" href="#Footnote_2r"><span class="sp">2</span></a> had it also a written
source or sources which we can trace? Though Hort doubts it,
most recent scholars (<i>e.g.</i> Waitz, Harnack) infer the existence
of at least one source, &ldquo;Preachings (<i>Kerygmata</i>) of Peter,&rdquo;
containing no reference at all to Clement. Such a work seems
implied by the epistle of Peter to James and its appended
adjuration, prefixed in our MSS. to the <i>Homilies</i> along with the
epistle of Clement to James. Thus the later work aimed at
superseding the earlier, much as Photius suggests (see above).
It was, then, to these &ldquo;Preachings of Peter&rdquo; that the most
Ebionite features, and especially the anti-Pauline allusions
under the guise of Simon still inhering in the <i>Periodoi</i> (as implied
by <i>Homilies</i> in particular), originally belonged. The fact,
however, that these were not more completely suppressed in
the later work, proves that it, too, arose in circles of kindred,
though largely modified, Judaeo-Christian sentiment (cf.
<i>Homilies</i>, vii., <i>e.g.</i> ch. 8). The differences of standpoint may be
due not only to lapse of time, and the emergence of new problems
on the horizon of Syrian Christianity generally, but also to change
in locality and in the degree of Greek culture represented by the
two works. A probable date for the &ldquo;Preachings&rdquo; used in the
<i>Periodoi</i> is c. 200.<a name="FnAnchor_3r" id="FnAnchor_3r" href="#Footnote_3r"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>If the home of the <i>Periodoi</i> was the region of the Syrian
Laodicea, we can readily explain most of its characteristics.
Photius refers to the &ldquo;excellences of its language and its learning&rdquo;;
while Waitz describes the aim and spirit of its contents
as those of an apology for Christianity against heresy and
paganism, in the widest sense of the word, written in order to
win over both Jews (cf. <i>Recognitions</i>, i. 53-70) and pagans, but
mainly the latter. In particular it had in view persons of
culture, as most apt to be swayed by the philosophical tendencies
in the sphere of religion prevalent in that age, the age of neo-Platonism.
It was in fact designed for propaganda among
religious seekers in a time of singular religious restlessness and
varied inquiry, and, above all, for use by catechumens (cf. <i>Ep.
Clem.</i> 2, 13) in the earlier stages of their preparation for Christian
baptism. To such its romantic setting would be specially
adapted, as falling in with the literary habits and tastes of the
period; while its doctrinal peculiarities would least give offence
in a work of the aim and character just described.</p>

<p>As regards the sources to the narrative part of the <i>Periodoi</i>,
it is possible that the &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; <i>motif</i> was a literary commonplace.
The account of Peter&rsquo;s journeyings was no doubt based
largely on local Syrian tradition, perhaps as already embodied
in written <i>Acts of Peter</i> (so Waitz and Harnack), but differing
from the Western type, <i>e.g.</i> in bringing Peter to Rome long
before Nero&rsquo;s reign. As for the allusions, more or less indirect,
to St Paul behind the figure of Simon, as the arch-enemy of the
truth&mdash;allusions which first directed attention to the Clementines
in the last century&mdash;there can be no doubt as to their presence,
but only as to their origin and the degree to which they are so
meant in <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>. There is certainly &ldquo;an
application to Simon of words used by or of St Paul, or of claims
made by or in behalf of St Paul&rdquo; (Hort), especially in <i>Homilies</i>
(ii. 17 f., xi. 35, xvii. 19), where a consciousness also of the
double reference must still be present, though this does not seem
to be the case in <i>Recognitions</i> (in Rufinus&rsquo;s Latin.) Such covert
reference to Paul must designedly have formed part of the
<i>Periodoi</i>, yet as adopted from its more bitterly anti-Pauline
basis, the &ldquo;Preachings of Peter&rdquo; (cf. <i>Homilies</i>, ii. 17 f. with <i>Ep.
Pet. ad Jac. 2</i>), which probably shared most of the features of
Ebionite Essenism as described by Epiphanius xxx. 15 f. (including
the qualified dualism of the two kingdoms&mdash;the present
one of the devil, and the future one of the angelic Christ&mdash;which
appears also in the <i>Periodoi</i>, cf. <i>Ep. Clem. ad Jac. 1 fin.</i>).</p>

<p>(b) That the <i>Periodoi</i> was a longer work than either our
<i>Homilies</i> or <i>Recognitions</i> is practically certain; and its mere
bulk may well, as Hort suggests (p. 88), have been a chief cause
of the changes of form. Yet <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i> are
abridgments made on different principles and convey rather
different impressions to their readers. &ldquo;The <i>Homilies</i> care most
for doctrine,&rdquo; especially philosophical doctrine, &ldquo;and seem to
transpose very freely for doctrinal purposes&rdquo; (<i>e.g.</i> matter in
xvi.-xix. is placed at the end for effect, while xx. 1-10 gives
additional emphasis to the <i>Homilies</i>&rsquo; theory of evil, perhaps over
against Manichaeism). &ldquo;The <i>Recognitions</i> care most for the
story,&rdquo; as a means of religious edification, &ldquo;and have preserved
the general framework much more nearly.&rdquo; They arose in
different circles: indeed, save the compiler of the text represented
by the Syriac MS. of 411 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, &ldquo;not a single ancient
writer shows a knowledge of both books in any form.&rdquo; But Hort
is hardly right in suggesting that, while <i>Homilies</i> arose in Syria,
<i>Recognitions</i> took shape in Rome. Both probably arose in
Syria (so Lightfoot), but in circles varying a good deal in religious
standpoint.<a name="FnAnchor_4r" id="FnAnchor_4r" href="#Footnote_4r"><span class="sp">4</span></a> <i>Homilies</i> was a sort of second edition, made largely
in the spirit of its original and perhaps in much the same locality,
with a view to maintaining and propagating the doctrines of a
semi-Judaic Christianity (cf. bk. vii.), as it existed a generation
or two after the <i>Periodoi</i> appeared. The <i>Recognitions</i>, in both
recensions, as is shown by the fact that it was read in the original
with general admiration not only by Rufinus but also by others
in the West, was more Catholic in tone and aimed chiefly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>494</span>
commending the Christian religion over against all non-Christian
rivals or gnostic perversions. That is, more than one effort of
this sort had been made to adapt the story of Clement&rsquo;s <i>Recognitions</i>
to general Christian use. Later the <i>Homilies</i> underwent
further adaptation to Catholic feeling even before the <i>Epitome</i>,
in its two extant forms, was made by more drastic methods of
expurgation. One kind of adaptation at least is proved to have
existed before the end of the 4th century, namely a selection of
certain discourses from the <i>Homilies</i> under special headings,
following on <i>Recognitions</i>, i.-iii., as seen in a Syriac MS.  of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 411.
As this MS. contains transcriptional errors, and as its archetype
had perhaps a Greek basis, the <i>Recognitions</i> may be dated
c. 350-375<a name="FnAnchor_5r" id="FnAnchor_5r" href="#Footnote_5r"><span class="sp">5</span></a> (its Christology suggested to Rufinus an Arianism
like that of Eunomius of Cyzicus, c. 362), and the <i>Homilies</i> prior
even to 350. But the different circles represented by the two
make relative dating precarious.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i>&mdash;The Clementine literature throws light upon a
very obscure phase of Christian development, that of
Judaeo-Christianity, and proves that it embraced more intermediate
types, between Ebionism proper and Catholicism, than has
generally been realized. Incidentally, too, its successive forms
illustrate many matters of belief and usage among Syrian
Christians generally in the 3rd and 4th centuries, notably their
apologetic and catechetical needs and methods. Further, it
discusses, as Hort observes, certain indestructible problems which
much early Christian theology passes by or deals with rather
perfunctorily; and it does so with a freshness and reality which,
as we compare the original 3rd-century basis with the conventional
manner of the <i>Epitome</i>, we see to be not unconnected with
origin in an age as yet free from the trammels of formal orthodoxy.
Again it is a notable specimen of early Christian pseudepigraphy,
and one which had manifold and far-reaching results.
Finally the romance to which it owed much of its popular appeal,
became, through the medium of Rufinus&rsquo;s Latin, the parent
of the late medieval legend of Faust, and so the ancestor of a
famous type in modern literature.</p>

of the Agiad line.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Cleomenes</span> I. was the son of Anaxandridas, whom he succeeded
about 520 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> His chief exploit was his crushing victory
near Tiryns over the Argives, some 6000 of whom he burned
to death in a sacred grove to which they had fled for refuge
(Herodotus vi. 76-82). This secured for Sparta the undisputed
hegemony of the Peloponnese. Cleomenes&rsquo; interposition in
the politics of central Greece was less successful. In 510 he
marched to Athens with a Spartan force to aid in expelling the
Peisistratidae, and subsequently returned to support the oligarchical
party, led by Isagoras, against Cleisthenes (<i>q.v.</i>). He
expelled seven hundred families and transferred the government
from the council to three hundred of the oligarchs, but being
blockaded in the Acropolis he was forced to capitulate. On his
return home he collected a large force with the intention of
making Isagoras despot of Athens, but the opposition of the
Corinthian allies and of his colleague Demaratus caused the
expedition to break up after reaching Eleusis (Herod. v. 64-76;
Aristotle, <i>Ath. Pol.</i> 19, 20). In 491 he went to Aegina to punish
the island for its submission to Darius, but the intrigues of his
colleague once again rendered his mission abortive. In revenge
Cleomenes accused Demaratus of illegitimacy and secured his
deposition in favour of Leotychides (Herod. vi. 50-73). But when
it was discovered that he had bribed the Delphian priestess to
substantiate his charge he was himself obliged to flee; he went
first to Thessaly and then to Arcadia, where he attempted to
foment an anti-Spartan rising. About 488 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was recalled,
but shortly afterwards, in a fit of madness, he committed suicide
(Herod. vi. 74, 75). Cleomenes seems to have received scant
justice at the hands of Herodotus or his informants, and Pausanias
(iii. 3, 4) does little more than condense Herodotus&rsquo;s narrative.
In spite of some failures, largely due to Demaratus&rsquo;s jealousy,
Cleomenes strengthened Sparta in the position, won during his
father&rsquo;s reign, of champion and leader of the Hellenic race; it
was to him, for example, that the Ionian cities of Asia Minor first
applied for aid in their revolt against Persia (Herod. v. 49-51).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For the chronology see J. Wells, <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i> (1905),
p. 193 ff., who assigns the Argive expedition to the outset of the
reign, whereas nearly all historians have dated it in or about 495 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Cleomenes</span> II. was the son of Cleombrotus I., brother and
successor of Agesipolis II. Nothing is recorded of his reign save
the fact that it lasted for nearly sixty-one years (370-309 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Cleomenes</span> III., the son and successor of Leonidas II., reigned
about 235-219 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He made a determined attempt to reform
the social condition of Sparta along the lines laid down by Agis
IV., whose widow Agiatis he married; at the same time he
aimed at restoring Sparta&rsquo;s hegemony in the Peloponnese.
After twice defeating the forces of the Achaean League in Arcadia,
near Mount Lycaeum and at Leuctra, he strengthened his position
by assassinating four of the ephors, abolishing the ephorate,
which had usurped the supreme power, and banishing some
eighty of the leading oligarchs. The authority of the council
was also curtailed, and a new board of magistrates, the <i>patronomi</i>,
became the chief officers of state. He appointed his own brother
Eucleidas as his colleague in succession to the Eurypontid
Archidamus, who had been murdered. His social reforms
included a redistribution of land, the remission of debts, the
restoration of the old system of training (<span class="grk" title="agôgê">&#7936;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>) and the admission
of picked perioeci into the citizen body. As a general Cleomenes
did much to revive Sparta&rsquo;s old prestige. He defeated the
Achaeans at Dyme, made himself master of Argos, and was
eventually joined by Corinth, Phlius, Epidaurus and other
cities. But Aratus, whose jealousy could not brook to see a
Spartan at the head of the Achaean league called in Antigonus
Doson of Macedonia, and Cleomenes, after conducting successful
expeditions to Megalopolis and Argos, was finally defeated at
Sellasia, to the north of Sparta, in 222 or 221 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He took
refuge at Alexandria with Ptolemy Euergetes, but was arrested
by his successor, Ptolemy Philopator, on a charge of conspiracy.
Escaping from prison he tried to raise a revolt, but the attempt
failed and to avoid capture he put an end to his life. Both as
general and as politician Cleomenes was one of Sparta&rsquo;s greatest
men, and with him perished her last hope of recovering her
ancient supremacy in Greece.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLEON<a name="ar196" id="ar196"></a></span> (d. 422 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Athenian politician during the Peloponnesian
War, was the son of Cleaenetus, from whom he inherited a
lucrative tannery business. He was the first prominent representative
of the commercial class in Athenian politics. He came
into notice first as an opponent of Pericles, to whom his advanced
ideas were naturally unacceptable, and in his opposition
somewhat curiously found himself acting in concert with the
aristocrats, who equally hated and feared Pericles. During the
dark days of 430, after the unsuccessful expedition of Pericles to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>495</span>
Peloponnesus, and when the city was devastated by the plague,
Cleon headed the opposition to the Periclean régime. Pericles
was accused by Cleon of maladministration of public money, with
the result that he was actually found guilty (see Grote&rsquo;s <i>Hist. of
Greece</i>, abridged ed., 1907, p. 406, note 1). A revulsion of feeling,
however, soon took place. Pericles was reinstated, and Cleon now
for a time fell into the background. The death of Pericles (429)
left the field clear for him. Hitherto he had only been a vigorous
opposition speaker, a trenchant critic and accuser of state
officials. He now came forward as the professed champion and
leader of the democracy, and, owing to the moderate abilities of
his rivals and opponents, he was for some years undoubtedly the
foremost man in Athens. Although rough and unpolished, he was
gifted with natural eloquence and a powerful voice, and knew
exactly how to work upon the feelings of the people. He
strengthened his hold on the poorer classes by his measure for
trebling the pay of the jurymen, which provided the poorer
Athenians with an easy means of livelihood. The notorious
fondness of the Athenians for litigation increased his power; and
the practice of &ldquo;sycophancy&rdquo; (raking up material for false
charges; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sycophant</a></span>), enabled him to remove those who were
likely to endanger his ascendancy. Having no further use for his
former aristocratic associates, he broke off all connexion with
them, and thus felt at liberty to attack the secret combinations
for political purposes, the oligarchical clubs to which they mostly
belonged. Whether he also introduced a property-tax for
military purposes, and even held a high position in connexion
with the treasury, is uncertain. His ruling principles were an
inveterate hatred of the nobility, and an equal hatred of Sparta.
It was mainly through him that the opportunity of concluding an
honourable peace (in 425) was lost, and in his determination to see
Sparta humbled he misled the people as to the extent of the
resources of the state, and dazzled them by promises of future
benefits.</p>

<p>In 427 Cleon gained an evil notoriety by his proposal to put to
death indiscriminately all the inhabitants of Mytilene, which had
put itself at the head of a revolt. His proposal, though accepted,
was, fortunately for the credit of Athens, rescinded, although, as it
was, the chief leaders and prominent men, numbering about 1000,
fell victims. In 425, he reached the summit of his fame by
capturing and transporting to Athens the Spartans who had been
blockaded in Sphacteria (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pylos</a></span>). Much of the credit was
probably due to the military skill of his colleague Demosthenes;
but it must be admitted that it was due to Cleon&rsquo;s determination
that the Ecclesia sent out the additional force which was needed.
It was almost certainly due to Cleon that the tribute of the
&ldquo;allies&rdquo; was doubled in 425 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Delian League</a></span>). In 422 he
was sent to recapture Amphipolis, but was outgeneralled by
Brasidas and killed. His death removed the chief obstacle to an
arrangement with Sparta, and in 421 the peace of Nicias was
concluded (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peloponnesian War</a></span>).</p>

<p>The character of Cleon is represented by Aristophanes and
Thucydides in an extremely unfavourable light. But neither can
be considered an unprejudiced witness. The poet had a grudge
against Cleon, who had accused him before the senate of having
ridiculed (in his <i>Babylonians</i>) the policy and institutions of his
country in the presence of foreigners and at the time of a great
national war. Thucydides, a man of strong oligarchical prejudices,
had also been prosecuted for military incapacity and
exiled by a decree proposed by Cleon. It is therefore likely that
Cleon has had less than justice done to him in the portraits
handed down by these two writers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEOPATRA<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span>, the regular name of the queens of Egypt in the
Ptolemaic dynasty after Cleopatra, daughter of the Seleucid
Antiochus the Great, wife of Ptolemy V., Epiphanes. The best
known was the daughter of Ptolemy XIII. Auletes, born 69 (or
68) <span class="scs">B.C.</span> At the age of seventeen she became queen of Egypt
jointly with her younger brother Ptolemy Dionysus, whose wife,
in accordance with Egyptian custom, she was to become. A few
years afterwards, deprived of all royal authority, she withdrew
into Syria, and made preparation to recover her rights by force of
arms. At this juncture Julius Caesar followed Pompey into
Egypt. The personal fascinations of Cleopatra induced him to
undertake a war on her behalf, in which Ptolemy lost his life, and
she was replaced on the throne in conjunction with a younger
brother, of whom, however, she soon rid herself by poison. In
Rome she lived openly with Caesar as his mistress until his
assassination, when, aware of her unpopularity, she returned at
once to Egypt. Subsequently she became the ally and mistress of
Mark Antony (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Antonius</a></span>). Their connexion was highly
unpopular at Rome, and Octavian (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Augustus</a></span>) declared war
upon them and defeated them at Actium (31 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Cleopatra
took to flight, and escaped to Alexandria, where Antony joined
her. Having no prospect of ultimate success, she accepted the
proposal of Octavian that she should assassinate Antony, and
enticed him to join her in a mausoleum which she had built in
order that &ldquo;they might die together.&rdquo; Antony committed
suicide, in the mistaken belief that she had already done so, but
Octavian refused to yield to the charms of Cleopatra who put an
end to her life, by applying an asp to her bosom, according to the
common tradition, in the thirty-ninth year of her age (29th of
August, 30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). With her ended the dynasty of the Ptolemies,
and Egypt was made a Roman province. Cleopatra had three
children by Antony, and by Julius Caesar, as some say, a son,
called Caesarion, who was put to death by Octavian. In her the
type of queen characteristic of the Macedonian dynasties stands
in the most brilliant light. Imperious will, masculine boldness,
relentless ambition like hers had been exhibited by queens of her
race since the old Macedonian days before Philip and Alexander.
But the last Cleopatra had perhaps some special intellectual
endowment. She surprised her generation by being able to
speak the many tongues of her subjects. There may have been
an individual quality in her luxurious profligacy, but then her
predecessors had not had the Roman lords of the world for
wooers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLEPSYDRA<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="klheptein">&#954;&#955;&#7952;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to steal, and <span class="grk" title="hudôr">&#8021;&#948;&#969;&#961;</span>, water),
the chronometer of the Greeks and Romans, which measured time
by the flow of water. In its simplest form it was a short-necked
earthenware globe of known capacity, pierced at the bottom with
several small holes, through which the water escaped or &ldquo;stole
away.&rdquo; The instrument was employed to set a limit to the
speeches in courts of justice, hence the phrases <i>aquam dare</i>, to give
the advocate speaking time, and <i>aquam perdere</i>, to waste time.
Smaller clepsydrae of glass were very early used in place of the
sun-dial, to mark the hours. But as the length of the hour varied
according to the season of the year, various arrangements, of
which we have no clear account, were necessary to obviate this
and other defects. For instance, the flow of water varied with the
temperature and pressure of the air, and secondly, the rate of flow
became less as the vessel emptied itself. The latter defect was
remedied by keeping the level of the water in the clepsydra
uniform, the volume of that discharged being noted. Plato is
said to have invented a complicated clepsydra to indicate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>496</span>
hours of the night as well as of the day. In the clepsydra or
hydraulic clock of Ctesibius of Alexandria, made about 135 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
the movement of water-wheels caused the gradual rise of a little
figure, which pointed out the hours with a little stick on an index
attached to the machine. The clepsydra is said to have been
known to the Egyptians. There was one in the Tower of the
Winds at Athens; and the turret on the south side of the tower is
supposed to have contained the cistern which supplied the water.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERESTORY<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Clearstory</span> (Ital. <i>chiaro piano</i>, Fr. <i>clairevoie</i>,
<i>claire étage</i>, Ger. <i>Lichtgaden</i>), in architecture, the upper
storey of the nave of a church, the walls of which rise above the
aisles and are pierced with windows (&ldquo;clere&rdquo; being simply
&ldquo;clear,&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;lighted&rdquo;). Sometimes these windows
are very small, being mere quatrefoils or spherical triangles.
In large buildings, however, they are important objects, both
for beauty and utility. The windows of the clerestories
of Norman work, even in large churches, are of less importance
than in the later styles. In Early English they became
larger; and in the Decorated they are more important still,
being lengthened as the triforium diminishes. In Perpendicular
work the latter often disappears altogether, and in many
later churches, as at Taunton, and many churches in Norfolk
and Suffolk, the clerestories are close ranges of windows. The
term is equally applicable to the Egyptian temples, where
the lighting of the hall of columns was obtained over the stone
roofs of the adjoining aisles, through slits pierced in vertical
slabs of stone. The Romans also in their baths and palaces
employed the same method, and probably derived it from the
Greeks; in the palaces at Crete, however, light-wells would
seem to have been employed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERFAYT<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Clairfayt</span>), <span class="bold">FRANÇOIS SEBASTIEN CHARLES
JOSEPH DE CROIX</span>, <span class="sc">Count of</span> (1733-1798), Austrian field
marshal, entered the Austrian army in 1753. In the Seven
Years&rsquo; War he greatly distinguished himself, earning rapid
promotion, and receiving the decoration of the order of Maria
Theresa. At the conclusion of the peace, though still under
thirty, he was already a colonel. During the outbreak of the
Netherlands in 1787, he was, as a Walloon by birth, subjected
to great pressure to induce him to abandon Joseph II., but he
resisted all overtures, and in the following year went to the
Turkish war in the rank of lieutenant field marshal. In an
independent command Clerfayt achieved great success, defeating
the Turks at Mehadia and Calafat. In 1792, as one of the most
distinguished of the emperor&rsquo;s generals, he received the command
of the Austrian contingent in the duke of Brunswick&rsquo;s army,
and at Croix-sous-Bois his corps inflicted a reverse on the troops
of the French revolution. In the Netherlands, to which quarter
he was transferred after Jemappes, he opened the campaign
of 1793 with the victory of Aldenhoven and the relief of Maestricht,
and on March 18th mainly brought about the complete
defeat of Dumouriez at Neerwinden. Later in the year, however,
his victorious career was checked by the reverse at Wattignies,
and in 1794 he was unsuccessful in West Flanders against
Pichegru. In the course of the campaign Clerfayt succeeded
the duke of Saxe-Coburg in the supreme command, but was
quite unable to make head against the French, and had to recross
the Rhine. In 1795, now field marshal, he commanded on the
middle Rhine against Jourdan, and this time the fortune of war
changed. Jourdan was beaten at Höchst and Mainz brilliantly
relieved. But the field marshal&rsquo;s action in concluding an
armistice with the French not being approved by Thugut, he
resigned the command, and became a member of the Aulic
Council in Vienna. He died in 1798. A brave and skilful
soldier, Clerfayt perhaps achieved more than any other Austrian
commander (except the archduke Charles) in the hopeless
struggle of small dynastic armies against a &ldquo;nation in arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERGY<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> (M.E. <i>clergie</i>, O. Fr. <i>clergie</i>, from Low Lat. form
<i>clericia</i> [Skeat], by assimilation with O. Fr. <i>clergié</i>, Fr. <i>clergé</i>,
from Low Lat. <i>clericatus</i>), a collective term signifying in English
strictly the body of &ldquo;clerks,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> men in holy orders (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Clerk</a></span>).
The word has, however, undergone sundry modifications of
meaning. Its M.E. senses of &ldquo;clerkship&rdquo; and &ldquo;learning&rdquo;
have long since fallen obsolete. On the other hand, in modern
times there has been an increasing tendency to depart from its
strict application to technical &ldquo;clerks,&rdquo; and to widen it out so as
to embrace all varieties of ordained Christian ministers. While,
however, it is now not unusual to speak of &ldquo;the Nonconformist
clergy,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;clergyman&rdquo; is still, at least in the United
Kingdom, used of the clergy of the Established Church in contradistinction
to &ldquo;minister.&rdquo; As applied to the Roman Catholic
Church the word embraces the whole hierarchy, whether its
<i>clerici</i> be in holy orders or merely in minor orders. The term
has also been sometimes loosely used to include the members of
the regular orders; but this use is improper, since monks and
friars, as such, have at no time been <i>clerici</i>. The use of the word
&ldquo;clergy&rdquo; as a plural, though the <i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes
the high authority of Cardinal Newman for it, is less rare than
wrong; in the case cited &ldquo;Some hundred Clergy&rdquo; should have
been &ldquo;Some hundred of the Clergy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In distinction to the &ldquo;clergy&rdquo; we find the &ldquo;laity&rdquo; (Gr. <span class="grk" title="laos">&#955;&#940;&#959;&#962;</span>,
people), the great body of &ldquo;faithful people&rdquo; which, in nearly
every various conception of the Christian Church, stands in
relation to the clergy as a flock of sheep to its pastor. This
distinction was of early growth, and developed, with the increasing
power of the hierarchy, during the middle ages into a very
lively opposition (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Order, Holy</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Church History</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Papacy</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Investitures</a></span>). The extreme claim of the great
medieval popes, that the priest, as &ldquo;ruler over spiritual things,&rdquo;
was as much superior to temporal rulers as the soul is to the
body (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Innocent III.</a></span>), led logically to the vast privileges
and immunities enjoyed by the clergy during the middle ages.
In those countries where the Reformation triumphed, this
triumph represented the victory of the civil over the clerical
powers in the long contest. The victory was, however, by no
means complete. The Presbyterian model was, for instance,
as sacerdotal in its essence as the Catholic; Milton complained
with justice that &ldquo;new presbyter is but old priest writ large,&rdquo;
and declared that &ldquo;the Title of Clergy St Peter gave to all God&rsquo;s
people,&rdquo; its later restriction being a papal and prelatical usurpation
(<i>i.e.</i> i Peter v. 3, for <span class="grk" title="klêros">&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="klêron">&#954;&#955;&#942;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span>).</p>

<p>Clerical immunities, of course, differed largely at different
times and in different countries, the extent of them having been
gradually curtailed from a period a little earlier than the close
of the middle ages. They consisted mainly in exemption from
public burdens, both as regarded person and pocket, and in
immunity from lay jurisdiction. This last enormous privilege,
which became one of the main and most efficient instruments
of the subjection of Europe to clerical tyranny, extended to
matters both civil and criminal; though, as Bingham shows,
it did not (always and everywhere) prevail in cases of heinous
crime (<i>Origines Eccles.</i> bk. v.).</p>

<p>This diversity of jurisdiction, and subjection of the clergy
only to the sentences of judges bribed by their <i>esprit de corps</i>
to judge leniently, led to the adoption of a scale of punishments
for the offences of clerks avowedly much lighter than that which
was inflicted for the same crimes on laymen; and this in turn
led to the survival in England, long after the Reformation, of
the curious legal fiction of benefit of clergy (see below), used to
mitigate the extreme harshness of the criminal law.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLERGY, BENEFIT OF<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span>, an obsolete but once very important
feature in English criminal law. Benefit of clergy began with
the claim on the part of the ecclesiastical authorities in the
12th century that every <i>clericus</i> should be exempt from the
jurisdiction of the temporal courts and be subject to the spiritual
courts alone. The issue of the conflict was that the common
law courts abandoned the extreme punishment of death assigned
to some offences when the person convicted was a <i>clericus</i>, and
the church was obliged to accept the compromise and let a
secondary punishment be inflicted. The term &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; or
<i>clericus</i> always included a large number of persons in what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>497</span>
were called minor orders, and in 1350 the privilege was extended
to secular as well as to religious clerks; and, finally, the test
of being a clerk was the ability to read the opening words of
verse 1 of Psalm li., hence generally known as the &ldquo;neck-verse.&rdquo;
Even this requirement was abolished in 1705. In 1487 it
was enacted that every layman, when convicted of a clergyable
felony, should be branded on the thumb, and disabled from
claiming the benefit a second time. The privilege was extended
to peers, even if they could not read, in 1547, and to women,
partially in 1622 and fully in 1692. The partial exemption
claimed by the Church did not apply to the more atrocious
crimes, and hence offences came to be divided into clergyable
and unclergyable. According to the common practice in England
of working out modern improvements through antiquated
forms, this exemption was made the means of modifying the
severity of the criminal law. It became the practice to claim
and be allowed the benefit of clergy; and when it was the
intention by statute to make a crime really punishable with
death, it was awarded &ldquo;without benefit of clergy.&rdquo; The benefit
of clergy was abolished by a statute of 1827, but as this statute
did not repeal that of 1547, under which peers were given the
privilege, a further statute was passed in 1841 putting peers on
the same footing as commons and clergy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERGY RESERVES<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span>, in Canada. By the act of 1791,
establishing the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, the
British government set apart one-eighth of all the crown lands
for the support of &ldquo;a Protestant clergy.&rdquo; These reservations,
after being for many years a stumbling-block to the economic
development of the province, and the cause of much bitter
political and ecclesiastical controversy, were secularized by the
Canadian parliament in 1854, and the proceeds applied to other
purposes, chiefly educational. Owing to the wording of the
imperial act, the amount set apart is often stated as one-seventh,
and was sometimes claimed as such by the clergy.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLERK<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span><a name="FnAnchor_1s" id="FnAnchor_1s" href="#Footnote_1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (from A.S. <i>cleric</i> or <i>clerc</i>, which, with the similar
Fr. form, comes direct from the Lat. <i>clericus</i>), in its original
sense, as used in the civil law, one who had taken religious
orders of whatever rank, whether &ldquo;holy&rdquo; or &ldquo;minor.&rdquo; The
word <i>clericus</i> is derived from the Greek <span class="grk" title="klêrikos">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;of or pertaining
to an inheritance,&rdquo; from <span class="grk" title="koêros">&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;lot,&rdquo; &ldquo;allotment,&rdquo; &ldquo;estate,&rdquo;
&ldquo;inheritance&rdquo;; but the authorities are by no means agreed
in which sense the root is connected with the sense of the derivative,
some conceiving that the original idea was that the clergy
received the service of God as their lot or portion; others that
they were the portion of the Lord; while others again, with
more reason as Bingham (<i>Orig. Eccl.</i> lib. i. cap. 5, sec. 9) seems
to think, maintain that the word has reference to the choosing
by lot, as in early ages was the case of those to whom public
offices were to be entrusted.</p>

<p>In the primitive times of the church the term canon was
used as synonymous with clerk, from the names of all the persons
in the service of any church having been inscribed on a roll, or
<span class="grk" title="kanon">&#954;&#945;&#957;&#974;&#957;</span>, whence they were termed <i>canonici</i>, a fact which shows
that the practice of the Roman Catholic Church of including
all persons of all ranks in the service of the church, ordained
or unordained, in the term clerks, or clergy, is at least in conformity
with the practice of antiquity. Thus, too, in English
ecclesiastical law, a clerk was any one who had been admitted
to the ecclesiastical state, and had taken the tonsure. The
application of the word in this sense gradually underwent a
change, and &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; became more especially the term applied
to those in minor orders, while those in &ldquo;major&rdquo; or &ldquo;holy&rdquo;
orders were designated in full &ldquo;clerks in holy orders,&rdquo; which in
English law still remains the designation of clergymen of the
Established Church. After the Reformation the word &ldquo;clerk&rdquo;
was still further extended to include laymen who performed
duties in cathedrals, churches, &amp;c., <i>e.g.</i> the choirmen, who were
designated &ldquo;lay clerks.&rdquo; Of these lay clerks or choirmen
there was always one whose duty it was to be constantly present
at every service, to sing or say the responses as the leader or
representative of the laity. His duties were gradually enlarged
to include the care of the church and precincts, assisting at
baptisms, marriages, &amp;c., and he thus became the precursor of
the later <i>parish clerk</i>. In a somewhat similar sense we find
<i>bible clerk, singing clerk</i>, &amp;c. The use of the word &ldquo;clerk&rdquo;
to denote a person ordained to the ministry is now mainly
legal or formal.</p>

<p>The word also developed in a different sense. In medieval
times the pursuit of letters and general learning was confined
to the clergy, and as they were practically the only persons who
could read and write all notarial and secretarial work was
discharged by them, so that in time the word was used with
special reference to secretaries, notaries, accountants or even
mere penmen. This special meaning developed into what is
now one of the ordinary senses of the word. We find, accordingly,
the term applied to those officers of courts, corporations, &amp;c.,
whose duty consists in keeping records, correspondence, and
generally managing business, as <i>clerk of the market, clerk of the
petty bag, clerk of the peace, town clerk</i>, &amp;c. Similarly, a clerk
also means any one who in a subordinate position is engaged
in writing, making entries, ordinary correspondence, or similar
&ldquo;clerkly&rdquo; work. In the United States the word means also
an assistant in a commercial house, a retail salesman.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERKENWELL<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span>, a district on the north side of the city of
London, England, within the metropolitan borough of Finsbury
(<i>q.v.</i>). It is so called from one of several wells or springs in this
district, near which miracle plays were performed by the parish
clerks of London. This well existed until the middle of the 19th
century. Here was situated a priory, founded in 1100, which
grew to great wealth and fame as the principal institution in
England of the Knights Hospitallers of the Order of St John of
Jerusalem. Its gateway, erected in 1504, and remaining in St
John&rsquo;s Square, served various purposes after the suppression of
the monasteries, being, for example, the birthplace of the
<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> in 1731, and the scene of Dr Johnson&rsquo;s
work in connexion with that journal. In modern times the
gatehouse again became associated with the Order, and is the
headquarters of the St John&rsquo;s Ambulance Association. An Early
English crypt remains beneath the neighbouring parish church of
St John, where the notorious deception of the &ldquo;Cock Lane
Ghost,&rdquo; in which Johnson took great interest, was exposed.
Adjoining the priory was St Mary&rsquo;s Benedictine nunnery, St
James&rsquo;s church (1792) marking the site, and preserving in its
vaults some of the ancient monuments. In the 17th century
Clerkenwell became a fashionable place of residence. A prison
erected here at this period gave place later to the House of
Detention, notorious as the scene of a Fenian outrage in 1867,
when it was sought to release certain prisoners by blowing up part
of the building. Clerkenwell is a centre of the watch-making and
jeweller&rsquo;s industries, long established here; and the Northampton

<p><span class="bold">CLERMONT-EN-BEAUVAISIS<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Clermont-de-l&rsquo;Oise</span>, a
town of northern France, capital of an arrondissement in the
department of Oise, on the right bank of the Brèche, 41 m. N. of
Paris on the Northern railway to Amiens. Pop. (1906) 4014.
The hill on which the town is built is surmounted by a keep of the
14th century, the relic of a fortress the site of which is partly
occupied by a large penitentiary for women. The church dates
from the 14th to the 16th centuries. The hôtel-de-ville, built by
King Charles IV., who was born at Clermont in 1294, is the oldest
in the north of France. The most attractive feature of the town is
the Promenade du Châtellier on the site of the old ramparts.
Clermont is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of first
instance, a communal college and a large lunatic asylum. It
manufactures felt and corsets, and carries on a trade in horses,
cattle and grain.</p>

<p>The town was probably founded during the time of the Norman
invasions, and was an important military post, during the middle
ages. It was several times taken and retaken by the contending
parties during the Hundred Years&rsquo; War, and the Wars of
Religion, and in 1615 Henry II., prince of Condé, was besieged
and captured there by the marshal d&rsquo;Ancre.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Counts of Clermont</span>. Clermont was at one time the seat of a
countship, the lords of which were already powerful in the 11th
century. Raoul de Clermont, constable of France, died at Acre
in 1191, leaving a daughter who brought Clermont to her husband,
Louis, count of Blois and Chartres. Theobald, count of Blois and
Clermont, died in 1218 without issue, and King Philip Augustus,
having received the countship of Clermont from the collateral
heirs of this lord, gave it to his son Philip Hurepel, whose daughter
Jeanne, and his widow, Mahaut, countess of Dammartin, next
held the countship. It was united by Saint Louis to the crown,
and afterwards given by him (1269) to his son Robert, from whom
sprang the house of Bourbon. In 1524 the countship of Clermont
was confiscated from the constable de Bourbon, and later (1540)
given to the duke of Orleans, to Catherine de&rsquo; Medici (1562), to
Eric, duke of Brunswick (1569), from whom it passed to his
brother-in-law Charles of Lorraine (1596), and finally to Henry II.,
prince of Condé (1611). In 1641 it was again confiscated from
Louis de Bourbon, count of Soissons, then in 1696 sold to Louis
Thomas Amadeus of Savoy, count of Soissons, in 1702 to Françoise
de Brancas, princesse d&rsquo;Harcourt, and in 1719 to Louis-Henry,
prince of Condé. From a branch of the old lords of Clermont
were descended the lords of Nesle and Chantilly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERMONT-FERRAND<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span>, a city of central France, capital of
the department of Puy-de-Dôme, 113 m. W. of Lyons on the
Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) town, 44,113; commune,
58,363. Clermont-Ferrand is situated on an eminence on the
western border of the fertile plain of Limagne. On the north, west
and south it is surrounded by hills, with a background of
mountains amongst which the Puy-de-Dôme stands out
prominently. A small river, the Tiretaine, borders the town on
the north. Since 1731 it has been composed of the two towns of
Clermont and Montferrand, now connected by a fine avenue of
walnut trees and willows, 2 m. in length, bordered on one side by
barracks. The watering-place of Royat lies a little more than
a mile to the west. Clermont has several handsome squares
ornamented with fountains, the chief of which is a graceful
structure erected by Bishop Jacques d&rsquo;Amboise in 1515. The
streets of the older and busier quarter of Clermont in the
neighbourhood of the cathedral and the Place de Jaude, the
principal square, are for the most part narrow, sombre and
bordered by old houses built of lava; boulevards divide this part
from more modern and spacious quarters, which adjoin it. To
the south lies the fine promenade known as the Jardin Lecoq.</p>

<p>The principal building is the cathedral, a Gothic edifice begun
in the 13th century. It was not completed, however, till the
19th century, when the west portal and towers and two bays
of the nave were added, according to the plans of Viollet-le-Duc.
The fine stained glass of the windows dates from the
13th to the 15th centuries. A monument of the Crusades with a
statue of Pope Urban II. stands in the Cathedral square. The
church of Notre-Dame du Port is a typical example of the
Romanesque style of Auvergne, dating chiefly from the 11th and
12th centuries. The exterior of the choir, with its four radiating
chapels, its jutting cornices supported by modillions and columns
with carved capitals, and its mosaic decoration of black and white
stones, is the most interesting part of the exterior. The rest of
the church comprises a narthex surmounted by a tower, three
naves and a transept, over which rises another tower. There are
several churches of minor importance in the town. Among the
old houses one, dating from the 16th century, was the birthplace
of Blaise Pascal, whose statue stands in a neighbouring square.
There is a statue of General Louis Charles Desaix de Veygoux in
the Place de Jaude. Montferrand has several interesting houses
of the 15th and 16th centuries, and a church of the 13th, 14th and
15th centuries.</p>

<p>Clermont-Ferrand is the seat of a bishopric and a prefecture
and headquarters of the XIII. army corps; it has tribunals
of first instance and of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators,
a chamber of commerce, an exchange and a branch of the Bank
of France. The town is the centre of an educational division
(<i>académie</i>), and has faculties of science and of literature. It also
has lycées and training colleges for both sexes, ecclesiastical
seminaries, a preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy,
schools of architecture, music, commerce and industry, museums
of art and antiquities and natural history and a library. A
great variety of industries is carried on, the chief being the
manufacture of semolina and other farinaceous foods, confectionery,
preserved fruit and jams, chemicals and rubber goods.
Liqueurs, chicory, chocolate, candles, hats, boots and shoes,
and woollen and linen goods are also made, and tanning is
practised. Clermont is the chief market for the grain and other
agricultural produce of Auvergne and Velay. Its waters are in
local repute. On the bank of the Tiretaine there is a remarkable
calcareous spring, the fountain of St Allyre, the copious deposits
of which have formed a curious natural bridge over the stream.</p>

<p>Clermont is identified with the ancient <i>Augustonemetum</i>, the
chief town of the Arverni, and it still preserves some remains of
the Roman period. The present name, derived from Clarus
Mons and originally applied only to the citadel, was used of the
town as early as the 9th century. During the disintegration of
the Roman empire Clermont suffered as much perhaps from
capture and pillage as any city in the country; its history during
the middle ages chiefly records the struggles between its bishops
and the counts of Auvergne, and between the citizens and their
overlord the bishop. It was the seat of seven ecclesiastical
councils, held in the years 535, 549, 587, 1095, 1110, 1124 and
1130; and of these the council of 1095 is for ever memorable as
that in which Pope Urban II. proclaimed the first crusade.
In the wars against the English in the 14th and 15th centuries
and the religious wars of the 16th century the town had its
full participation; and in 1665 it acquired a terrible notoriety
by the trial and execution of many members of the nobility
of Auvergne who had tyrannized over the neighbouring districts.
The proceedings lasted six months, and the episode is known
as <i>les Grands Jours de Clermont</i>. Before the Revolution the
town possessed several monastic establishments, of which the
most important were the abbey of Saint Allyre, founded, it is
said, in the 3rd century by St Austremonius (St Stremoine), the
apostle of Auvergne and first bishop of Clermont, and the abbey
of St André, where the counts of Clermont were interred.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERMONT-GANNEAU, CHARLES SIMON<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> (1846-&emsp;&emsp;),
French Orientalist, the son of a sculptor of some repute, was born
in Paris on the 19th of February 1846. After an education
at the École des Langues Orientales, he entered the diplomatic
service as dragoman to the consulate at Jerusalem, and
afterwards at Constantinople. He laid the foundation of his
reputation by his discovery (in 1870) of the &ldquo;stele&rdquo; of Mesha
(Moabite Stone), which bears the oldest Semitic inscription
known. In 1874 he was employed by the British government to
take charge of an archaeological expedition to Palestine, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span>
subsequently entrusted by his own government with similar
missions to Syria and the Red Sea. He was made chevalier of
the Legion of Honour in 1875. After serving as vice-consul at
Jaffa from 1880 to 1882, he returned to Paris as &ldquo;secrétaire-interprète&rdquo;
for oriental languages, and in 1886 was appointed
consul of the first class. He subsequently accepted the post of
director of the École des Langues Orientales and professor at
the Collège de France. In 1889 he was elected a member of the
Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, of which he had
been a correspondent since 1880. In 1896 he was promoted
to be consul-general, and was minister plenipotentiary in 1906.
He was the first in England to expose the famous forgeries of
Hebrew texts offered to the British Museum by M.W. Shapira (<i>q.v.</i>)
in 1883, and in 1903 he took a prominent part in the investigation
of the so-called &ldquo;tiara of Saïtapharnes.&rdquo; This tiara had been
purchased by the Louvre for 400,000 francs, and exhibited as
a genuine antique. Much discussion arose as to the perpetrators
of the fraud, some believing that it came from southern Russia.
It was agreed, however, that the whole object, except perhaps the
band round the tiara, was of modern manufacture.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His chief publications, besides a number of contributions to
journals, are:&mdash;<i>Palestine inconnue</i> (1886), <i>Études d&rsquo;archéologie

<p><span class="bold">CLERMONT-L&rsquo;HERAULT<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Clermont de Lodève</span>, a town
of southern France in the department of Hérault, 10 m. S.S.E.
by rail of Lodève. Pop. (1906) 4731. The town is built on the
slope of a hill which is crowned by an ancient castle and skirted
by the Rhonel, a tributary of the Lergue. It has an interesting
church of the 13th and 14th centuries. The chief manufacture
is that of cloth for military clothing, and woollen goods, an
industry which dates from the latter half of the 17th century.
Tanning and leather-dressing are also carried on, and there is
trade in wine, wool and grain. Among the public institutions
are a tribunal of commerce, a chamber of arts and manufactures,
a board of trade-arbitration and a communal college. The town
was several times taken and retaken in the religious wars of
the 16th century.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLERMONT-TONNERRE<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span>, the name of a French family,
members of which played some part in the history of France,
especially in Dauphiné, from about 1100 to the Revolution.
Sibaud, lord of Clermont in Viennois, who first appears in 1080,
was the founder of the family. His descendant, another Sibaud,
commanded some troops which aided Pope Calixtus II. in his
struggle with the anti-pope Gregory VIII.; and in return for this
service it is said that the pope allowed him to add certain emblems&mdash;two
keys and a tiara&mdash;to the arms of his family. A
direct descendant, Ainard (d. 1349), called vicomte de Clermont,
was granted the dignity of captain-general and first baron of
Dauphiné by his suzerain Humbert, dauphin of Viennois, in
1340; and in 1547 Clermont was made a county for Antoine
(d. 1578), who was governor of Dauphiné and the French king&rsquo;s
lieutenant in Savoy. In 1572 Antoine&rsquo;s son Henri was created
a duke, but as this was only a &ldquo;brevet&rdquo; title it did not descend
to his son. Henri was killed before La Rochelle in 1573. In 1596
Henri&rsquo;s son, Charles Henri, count of Clermont (d. 1640), added
Tonnerre to his heritage; but in 1648 this county was sold by
his son and successor, François (d. 1679).</p>

<p>A member of a younger branch of Charles Henri&rsquo;s descendants
was Gaspard de Clermont-Tonnerre (1688-1781). This soldier
served his country during a long period, fighting in Bohemia
and Alsace, and then distinguishing himself greatly at the battles
of Fontenoy and Lawfeldt. In 1775 he was created duke of
Clermont-Tonnerre, and made a peer of France; as the senior
marshal (cr. 1747) of France he assisted as constable at the coronation
of Louis XVI. in 1774. His son and successor, Charles
Henri Jules, governor of Dauphiné, was guillotined in July 1794,
a fate which his grandson, Gaspard Charles, had suffered at Lyons
in the previous year. A later duke, Aimé Marie Gaspard (1779-1865),
served for some years as a soldier, afterwards becoming
minister of marine and then minister of war under Charles X.,
and retiring into private life after the revolution of 1830. Aimé&rsquo;s
grandson, Roger, duke of Clermont-Tonnerre, was born in 1842.</p>

<p>Among other distinguished members of this family was
Catherine (c. 1545-1603), only daughter of Claude de Clermont-Tonnerre.
This lady, <i>dame d&rsquo;honneur</i> to Henry II.&rsquo;s queen,
Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, and afterwards wife of Albert de Gondi,
due de Retz, won a great reputation by her intellectual attainments,
being referred to as the &ldquo;tenth muse&rdquo; and the &ldquo;fourth
grace.&rdquo; One of her grandsons was the famous cardinal de Retz.
Other noteworthy members of collateral branches of the family
were: François (1629-1701), bishop of Noyon from 1661 until
his death, a member of the French Academy, notorious for his
inordinate vanity; Stanislas M. A., comte de Clermont-Tonnerre
(<i>q.v.</i>); and Anne Antoine Jules (1740-1830), cardinal and bishop
of Châlons, who was a member of the states-general in 1789,
afterwards retiring into Germany, and after the return of the
Bourbons to France became archbishop of Toulouse.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CLERMONT-TONNERRE, STANISLAS MARIE ADELAIDE<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span>,
<span class="sc">Comte de</span> (1757-1792), French politican, was born at Pont-à-Mousson
on the 10th of October 1757. At the beginning of the
Revolution he was a colonel, with some reputation as a freemason
and a Liberal. He was elected to the states-general of
1789 by the noblesse of Paris, and was the spokesman of the
minority of Liberal nobles who joined the Third Estate on the
25th of June. He desired to model the new constitution of
France on that of England. He was elected president of the
Constituent Assembly on the 17th of August 1789; but on the
rejection by the Assembly of the scheme elaborated by the first
constitutional committee, he attached himself to the party of
moderate royalists, known as <i>monarchiens</i>, led by P.V. Malouet.
His speech in favour of reserving to the crown the right of
absolute veto under the new constitution drew down upon him
the wrath of the advanced politicians of the Palais Royal;
but in spite of threats and abuse he continued to advocate a
moderate liberal policy, especially in the matter of removing
the political disabilities of Jews and Protestants and of extending
the system of trial by jury. In January 1790 he collaborated
with Malouet in founding the Club des Impartiaux and the
<i>Journal des Impartiaux</i>, the names of which were changed in
November to the Société des Amis de la Constitution Monarchique
and <i>Journal de la Société, &amp;c.</i>. in order to emphasize their opposition
to the Jacobins (Société des Amis de la Constitution). This
club was denounced by Barnave in the Assembly (January 21st,
1791), and on the 28th of March it was attacked by a mob,
whereupon it was closed by order of the Assembly. Clermont-Tonnerre
was murdered by the populace during the rising of the
9th and 10th of August 1792. He was an excellent orator,
having acquired practice in speaking, before the Revolution, in
the masonic lodges. He is a good representative of the type of
the <i>grands seigneurs</i> holding advanced and liberal ideas, who
helped to bring about the movement of 1789, and then tried
in vain to arrest its course.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CLERUCHY<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span>
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="klêrouchia">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#945;</span>, from <span class="grk" title="klêros">&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, a lot, <span class="grk" title="echein">&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to have),
in ancient Greek history a kind of colony composed of Athenian<a name="FnAnchor_1t" id="FnAnchor_1t" href="#Footnote_1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
citizens planted, practically as a garrison, in a conquered country.
Strictly, the settlers (cleruchs) were not colonists, inasmuch
as they retained their status as citizens of Athens (<i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="ho dêmos ho en Hphaistia">
&#8001; &#948;&#8134;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#8001; &#7952;&#957; &#905;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#8115;</span>), and their allotments were politically part of
Attic soil. These settlements were of three kinds: (1) where
the earlier inhabitants were extirpated or expatriated, and the
settlers occupied the whole territory; (2) where the settlers
occupied allotments in the midst of a conquered people; and
(3) where the inhabitants gave up portions of land to settlers
in return for certain pecuniary concessions. The primary
object (cf. the 4000 cleruchs settled in 506 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> upon the lands of
the conquered oligarchs of Euboea, known as the Hippobotae)
was unquestionably military, and in the later days of the Delian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
League the system was the simplest precaution against disaffection
on the part of the allies, the strength of whose resentment
may be gathered from an inscription (Hicks and Hill, 101
[81]), which, in setting forth the terms of the second Delian
Confederacy, expressly forbids the holding of land by Athenians
in allied territory.</p>

<p>A secondary object of the cleruchies was social or agrarian,
to provide a source of livelihood to the poorer Athenians.
Plutarch (<i>Pericles</i>, 11) suggests that Pericles by this means rid
the city of the idle and mischievous loafers; but it would
appear that the cleruchs were selected by lot, and in any case
a wise policy would not deliberately entrust important military
duties to recognized wastrels. When we remember that in 50
years of the 5th century some 10,000 cleruchs went out, it is
clear that the drain on the citizen population was considerable.</p>

<p>It is impossible to decide precisely how far the state retained
control over the cleruchs. Certainly they were liable to military
service and presumably to that taxation which fell upon Athenians
at home. That they were not liable for the tribute which
members of the Delian League paid is clear from the fact that
the assessments of places where cleruchs were settled immediately
went down considerably (cf. the Periclean cleruchies,
450-445); indeed, this follows from their status as Athenian
citizens, which is emphasized by the fact that they retained
their membership of deme and tribe. In internal government
the cleruchs adopted the Boul&#275; and Assembly system of Athens
itself; so we read of Polemarchs, Archons Eponymi, Agoranomi,
Strategi, in various places. With a measure of local self-government
there was also combined a certain central authority (<i>e.g.</i>
in the matter of jurisdiction, some case being tried by the
Nautodicae at Athens); in fact we may assume that the more
important cases, particularly those between a cleruch and a
citizen at home, were tried before the Athenian dicasts. In a
few cases, the cleruchs, <i>e.g.</i> in the case of Lesbos (427), were
apparently allowed to remain in Athens receiving rent for their
allotments from the original Lesbian owners (Thuc. iii. 50);
but this represents the perversion of the original idea of the
cleruchy to a system of reward and punishment.</p>
